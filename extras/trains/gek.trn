hi
i wonder how many contractors or business owners secretly supported sb 60
the u.s. can never stop illegal immigration
might as well have insured drivers
they basically have that now
except way more militarized and less effective
this is what i need: a web-based request tracker where any anonymous idiot can come, fill out a support request which goes into a moderated queue which an admin can then redirect to an appropriate category/class of responders
any ideas?
rt allows people to submit requests without getting an account first?
Fahrvergnugen: dunno, maybe, i wanted a non-hackish thing
i see, interesting
"The wealthy classes of the United States, Israel and other places will realize: the price we pay for expropriating the resources of the world and living in luxury over our slaves is that -- more and more, on any given day -- we or the ones we love could be blown to smithereens."
thats from carlos the jackal's new book
its out now
i dont know if it will be sold in the US though
its out in france and UK
i wonder if its possible to make the US like israel
in israel, people dont go out, dont go to clubs, live in fear, etc
in some places, that is
carlos the jackal has survived a lot longer, though
and gotten away with more shit
of course, he's in prison now
i mean, george bush can barely find osama bin laden
carlos kidnapped 11 opec ministers and got away
toast: i agree, too
toast: agree to the extent that there are tens of thousands of people who want to make that a reality for people in the US, at least
and they've done a pretty good job in other places
there's really no defense against it
the real factor is the cowardice of US troops
these are just normal kids who want a college education
compare them to israeli soldiers who are facing the same circumstances but are raised in a militarized society
that US troops dont have the stomachs to defend against a guerrilla war
naw, the troops are just random kids... even israeli soldiers have a hard time and they've grown up in war
the real danger to us troops is that politically the us wont be able to withdraw, and the guerrillas start getting international support which spikes their ability to hit us assets

anyway, here's to randomly exploding shopping malls and free state-supplied gasmasks
support your local communist
insublogs/2003/insub.log.01Jul2003:[14:19] <twid> 14:15 @<gek> anyway, here's to randomly exploding shopping malls and free
sorry, got distracted by work
but yes, my point is that US could be like israel
all the reasons you give for why it cant be are reasons why it can be
israel is small, with militarized borders
its easy to just close off palestinian territories
oh
why isnt israel in germany? :(
the next largest zionist faction at the time wanted it to be in uganda
their problem is zionism is an expasionist ideology which demands more land for fundamentalist reasons
thats why the matrix was banned in egypt
just like movies which support our enemies are banned here, i imagine
Fahrvergnugen: certainly it is the same with the matrix in egypt
it isnt in any commercial cinemas but you can get it on the internet, in marketplaces, etc
oh no
i'll be exposed to the world :(
someone please fix me :(
thanks toast!!
dont get too excited about may day
around here it'll kind of be like this: http://sf.indymedia.org/uploads/naked_ufo.jpg
meanwhile, in the free world:

huey lewis?
huey newton too
you must be from SF, huh?
now lennox lewis, he's black
i just saw a motorcade of sfpd motorcycles and SUVs driving with an australian diplomatic car but the strange thing is
terrence hallinan was driving in the lead police cruiser waving at people
hello
so listen.. arent you all wary of the creepers that hep drags in here?
i cant rephrase it to make it any closer to what its supposed to mean
oh so everythings about YOU, huh?
you're the one with a capitalized nick
you think you're so fkn important or something?
NO
hm, lets see
i hate people with your skin color?
hm, everyone knows sherrod is spelled with one r?
whats wrong with you?
heh, a u.s. soldier drove his tank into a canal near baghdad
then he drowned
well, it was actually in fallujah
and shortly after someone threw 2 grenades at a group of soldiers there
7 injured
one more grenade and that ratio could have been made saner
remember that guy from oakland who fragged some officers right when the war started?
i've got nothing to say about that, i just like to remember it
hindustan times is not to be trusted :(
they are so right-wing, and so is drudge
hi
i hope god told him soldiers would keep getting picked off one by one
AND bombing ib beirut today
And 40 dead vs. chechen rebels yesterday
terror is winning!!
yeah
and the islamic & communist groups in palestine are about ready to resume i think
and the bush administration said that dismantling hamas & pflp et al is not a prerequisite to the road map anymore
that was yesterday
nooo, thats good
the palestinian side of course
right, i'm on the side of "us"
i would support carving out a piece of canada and making it the new state of israel
you know under the original zionist conferences, the two main choices for israel was where it is now
and a big chunk of land in uganda
the uganda plan had a lot of support
Hezbollah says Israel behind Beirut blast that killed Iranian embassy driver
Supremes rule police need only wait 15-20 seconds before breaking in to execute a search warrant. :/
i just want to know the difference between that and a no-knock search
basically they are all no-knock searches now
http://www.tribnet.com/24hour/nation/story/1076462p-7519988c.html
sure
but knock, wait 15 seconds, then go, whats the difference?
normally i dont answer the door in 15 seconds
i just dont want them to shoot my dog
... or any evidence they are seeking which could theoretically be destroyed in a few minutes
i.e. anything
now which is worse -- the new 15 second search where they've already busted down your door and shot your dog?
or the patriot act secret searches where you dont find out for 6 months you're house has been searched 10 times?
your
the cops always get off
its the same thing that started the riots in cincinnati when timothy thomas was murdered
really it happens all the time
when that kid got killed at the metreon it was like 18 shots
by SFPD
they are like their comrades in iraq
over-armed and cowardly
theres a movie showing this friday about the cincinnati riots actually
in the east bay
put on by copwatch..
kingmob: you know them?
ohio copwatch, i mean
copwatch there did a lot
but then it got creepy, with columbus police following people everywhere
and you would come out of your house and they would be there
and they would call out your name
right now?
i used to like in the 300-block of chittenden
and then i lived near 8th & high
during those copwatch glory days as well :)
there were a lot of nice little riots 
mm, no like 96-97 i think?
maybe 95
when there were the black festivals and every year the police would attack it
and it would be a riot
on thurs, fri and sat, are there still like 200 cops who close down high street?
oh
whats there in their place?
i left right around when all the weird copwatch stuff started happening
because i went to jail and other things around that
right around the time the DOJ announced they were starting their investigation of cols police
yes, campus partners was a main target :)
yeah, i know their plan was like, from the river to the highway
and from short north to mmm i forget that main road
hahahah
a fine fkn plan
erupt in flame?
it seemed like every year some frathouse would burn down and kill like 4 fratboys or something
excellent!
when i lived there, it was like, the first 2 blocks west of high on chittenden were frathouses and then bam, it turned into a normal ghetto
is it still non-frat there?
nice
better than being campus partners condos
when i lived there it was almost all black families
yeah, thats where i was
excellent
thats what i meant, 2 blocks east of high on chittenden
anyways
not a bad place
columbus, i mean
its a violent area there, for sure
i got in a handful of fights walking home at night during the 3 years i lived there
and one time i got "mugged" by a 12 year old
and i was extraordinarily drunk
but thats another story
oh yeah, isnt it nice up there?
and then someone got stabbed to death in my front lawn, that was another fine night
yeah i had a gun when i lived there
hep = jealous
i could barely afford my rent where i was staying
and it was like $230/month
those were the days of cheap cheap rent
california snobs
ignore them

er, when the opportunity is passed, its gone forever
or something
Two months ago, in harmony with the clergies of many cities and towns, the head of juridical power who escaped Saddam Hussein's purges and came to Iran from Najaf twenty years ago, called Internet as "Trojan horse that carries enemy soldiers in his abdomen".
further consultation with experts made clergies to realize that it is not possible to limit the use of Internet by laws and punishment. Therefore, they set up the greatest hack station called "Islam Hacker" in Qum that managed to disrupt a few internet sites.
when you have your own greatest hack station, 
then lets talk
JESUS
when i get my north korean hacker power drink in the mail, you will all be so fucking sorry
150 milliliters of the drink has been applied to each of several dozen computer operators twice a day for scores of days. The results show that the eye and mental strain has considerably been reduced. They say they do not feel tired though they operate computers for many hours.
who the hell is gweeds?
aw
cj, hep was saying she was trying to convince you to get a little puppy
you guys should do it!
typical confusionism
hey, the hemisphere stuff is good
THE SPLIT BRAINS PROVE IT
well i dunno about it being anecdotal..
myers & sperry severed many a cat's corpus callosum 
5000 MUTILATED CATS CANT BE WRONG
hey, those cats brains were incised so that we could take internet tests like that one
well, whatever, it only hurts when their anaesthesia funding gets cut
http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/030501/168/3y291.html
told you they cared, counterhepolution
who the hell is girlvinyl?
its because he is more right wing than arnold
well arnold is like a "i got bought off by rich corporations" right-wing
whereas the other faction is the "we love god and hate abortion/niggers/fags" right-wing
right
yeah, because the gop's values are being corrupted by multinationals
definitely they used to have values
those segregationists were strange, fucked up people
just saying they were driven by values, not just money
it was kind of funny a minute ago.. not anymore
aw, it was just getting good
pfft, i lived in reynoldsburg, ohio for a year
stayed in xenia for a while too
they made a movie about how hick xenia is
most hick place in the bay area
to people in ohio, anywhere near san francisco is wall-to-wall rich gay people
nah, ohioans know that they live in jew york city
hahah, there is so much antisemitism in ohio
for instance, in the town where my uncle is from which is kind of a city, more like an industrial suburb of cleveland
every single jewish person you know is rich
and everyone else isnt
that contributes to it
and the jewish suburbs of cleveland are all very affluent
well, i'm just trying to explain where anti-semitism comes from
in ohio, at least
*i* dont necessarily think that
but of the people i know who are anti-semitic, thats what they think
like my father, for instance
or anyone else in my family
cj_: nah, its because they are rich
nooo, thats like 16th-century antisemitism
modern day antisemitism is that jews are a small, insular culture of people who try to own banks and be merchants and shit
thats european antisemitism
in hick places like ohio, its because they are all doctors or lawyers or something
or there are a lot of jews in hollywood, you get that alot
and then there is the jew/black rivalry
austin: good point
like, prominent black civil rights people are often called anti-semtitic
like farrakahn is because he's a muslim, and he is against israel
but also because there are critiques of media portrayal of blacks, and so people like chuck d or ice cube are accused of being anti-semitic
anti-semitism, i can slow down for you if you want?
like for instance, ice cube puts a lot on his albums about it
because he's also accused of being anti-korean after the la riots
whats the propaganda? its just the fact..
during the la riots, there was a lot made about how lots of korean storeowners are in south central la
and how the blacks when they rioted went after korean store owners
people like ice cube were saying they arent anti-korean, they are against non-black ownership in black neighborhoods
but also, they were advocating murdering immigrant korean store owners
thus, the debate ..
well, it just ties into how those same people in the early 90s were accused of being anti-semitic
anyway, like ice cube says, "nigger, don't say the j word, but i thought they were bugging, because to us uncle sam is hitler without ovens"
or the other clip on that album... which is him being interviewed, and they say "ice cube, you've been accused of being anti-woman, anti-jew, anti-korean" etc
the point is one form of anti-semitism in the u.s. can be possibly found in black civil rights activists, because they are accused of anti-semitism
hey, cj just asked what form anti-semitism takes these days
i'm just describing some that i know about
you can decide for yourself if it is or not
well, mostly the rationale is that jews are rich or influential in the media
or related in some way to opposition of israel
that is the perception, that the jewish lobbying community and nepotism culture is strong
except in hollywood
also, the JDL is very active in california

I was on rowdy movie sets, I have offended people, when I am governor I will prove to women that I will be a champion for women.
 Republican political consultant Allan Hoffenblum said that for the issue to harm Schwarzenegger's campaign, "they would have had to come up with something completely new. This is not a new issue."
haha
its beyond chauvinism into some kind of disorder i think
A fifth woman said Schwarzenegger groped her and tried to remove her bathing suit in a hotel elevator. 
hello
cowards!
no :(
central computer recently sold me a fucked up seagate drive.. i lost the receipt but i had the plastic case it came in with THEIR barcode and THEIR identification number on it
but when they ran the number they claimed they couldnt find it and they never sold it to me

mw: do you personally know marissa mayer?
she is still pm for news.google ?
ok thanks
eh, long story and i'm about out the door.. in a nutshell, news.google took indymedia out because we HAPPENED to have an INNOCENT article that refers to 'zionazis' and when we had a conference call with google because they took us out of the news.google spider over it
and it was with marissa mayer, and i wanted to make sure she is still at google, etc
yeah, i just wanted to make sure she didnt get a new job or something
and switzerland, i think
but you can find stuff if you search for "raghead"
or "islamofascist"
its a decentralized network of groups organized similarly of an extreme left orientation
some stuff is liberal, but mostly liberals are made fun of in indymedia
but mostly it is for doing tech infrastructure at major protests or warzones or areas in control by leftist rebels
twid: i just think you misuse the term liberal
indymedia is mostly anti-capitalist which is distinct from liberal
well, those are causes used by anti-capitalists, but for instance the most liberal you will get is support of green party candidates and even that is frowned on at most indymedia's
what i'm saying is that's an issue that used by people on the left, but not everyone on the left is liberal
you can go from liberal to anti-capitalist to stalinist to leninist, etc etc
well, either way, the webpage is only a small part of it
mostly its about tech infrastructure in places that need it
like at major protests, doing pirate radio or wireless stuff or whatever
or where there are anti-capitalist warzones, doing tech infrastructure there
hahah, worse than that
486s with spanish debian
and in fact most of them are floating on a barge outside quito
they can get a 56k modem, but they have to fill out a dozen forms and go to our office of modem improvement
to find out where that office is, there are 4-5 forms
usually you need 10 forms just to find this out, but you guys have a bureaucratic connection here
now seriously, this is getting close to party treason
zip it
hi
has anyone used utf-8 in bitchx?
yeah
i think its irssi for me 
i think i'll use mlterm
its going to take forever to make it look nice though

switching from fbsd to redflag linux
in china you can buy a pc with linux pre-installed in any major department store
they have linux desktops at walmart?
not bad
well the competition is hard because you can get pirated windows and everything else just about anywhere in china
that campaign is run by dick gephardt's group
anyone have overwhelming problems with fbsd 5.1?
i'm going to upgrade my work laptop
cool
so i'm installing freebsd 5.1 from cd, and it says pkg_add: package 'perl-5.6.1_13' or its older version already installed
which means expat cant be installed
which means x libraries cant be installed
now it is caught in a loop i cant get out of
bsd = better setup debian :(
Unable to transfer all components of XFree86 distribution. 
and you know what else?
i may wish to switch medi types and try again
media even
a thoughtful suggestion
anyways, it was because i didnt destroy my old partitions and it didnt think to wipe them, it just went with it
and that fucked things up
the new fbsd boot manager is fullscreen
with a big ascii fbsd devil :(
or this channel
oh good, now my screen is filled with ACPI-0293: Warning: Buffer created with zero length in AML
searching for that on google finds a bunch of people with dell laptops experiencing the same thing upon upgrading to 5.1
no solution, just lots of complaints
this is good, no?
gomi: 5.1 or otherwise? because 4.8 worked beautifully
i am using current
it doesnt work
well, sure
but it still doesnt work
haha, the official word from freebsd irc?
[22:53] <hash> gek: yes, install 4.8 :)
[22:53] <zhentil> rollback ryan ;)
THANKS FBSD!
[22:54] <mij> 5.1 has plenty of issues
anyone here know a cvs tutorial in spanish?
babelfish is useless for the most part
5.1 sysinstall randomly reboots your computer
its cool
hi chris
well kids, you can burn american flags tomorrow at the fireworks-watching thing near berkeley docks
lots of people will be there doing it
oh shit
FIX ME
TODAY I MEAN
it wouldnt be hard
thats the problem
by OWNED hep means she was once again embarrassed while defending djb
holy shit
for the record i have NEVER said that
<Sherrod> they actually say that shit?
the answer is NO
hep is delusional
interesting
you'll get yours hep
eff is now affirmatively suing diebold
now the county election board can just read the internal diebold mailing lists which basically say things like have happened
didnt even use the password feature
i'm going to go visit diebold this week
harrass them on behalf of indymedia
no
ohio
the only bad part is if diebold really sues us
there's like 10 people whose personal assets would be up for grabs
i cant answer that question
except to say that no, there are no copies on any official IMC server
but the reason they would sue is that we rejected their cease and desist order
but yeah anyway
we rejected the cease and desist and made a big deal out of it
and worked with eff to get it in the AP and elsewhere, etc
we had a unique situation where both the ISP and website were willing to reject the cease and desist
eff people are part of the arrangement because its like a spider's web and if any shady corporate orders come our way we have ISP/site collaboration, which is rare
all the other imc servers and most everyone else has to comply
ell they are already hard-pressed to notify the ISP
thats why EFF is suing, to set a precedent against dmca compliance by the isp
not many isp's have tested the safe harbor provision of dmca
they just go along with it
16 dead, 30 wounded with that chinook from yesterday
i agree that landlord system is pure evil, but given that, i think renting is a much better option for most people
no property taxes, no lawsuits, no burden of ownership, etc
its like that either way, and if you arent financially stable enough to deal with ownership, you're doubly screwed
its nice to just leave somewhere and never have to think about it again
Sherrod: you have to think about selling it
i think if i tried to start that by buying a house i'd be laughed out of every bank
good hustle = fake id, fake ssn, etc
somehow i doubt the twinkle in my eye is gonna get a loan rep to sign papers
t12: more specific? like when the loan officer says you have no money, no chance of getting money, you are an ex-con, you look ugly, you dont talk right, and i dont believe you could buy a stick of gum let alone maintain a mortgage ..?
blow them a kiss?
haha, i mean i know lots of people who have legitimately tried to get home loans and failed
and they even work hard, have a steady job, have commitment, etc
well then, let's hear the great scam to get free home loans!
write a text file or something
ok
cronyism != hustle
it really, really isnt
hahah, ok.. but i bet the loan officer's heard "my cousin's the mayor" before
i think its right to say that some people can ride into a loan or other things like that
its not right to say anyone could
i think you also have to consider who can afford to take the risk of loan fraud
well, i dont know whats happening because all i hear is hustle and famous relatives :)
either way, i want a house
now make it happen
sigh, i knew i'd be on my knees again
but like, housing discrimination is a good example about why there are structural barriers
in 1955 you could not tell a black person to just "hustle" because even if they were good risk for a loan they wouldnt get it
really, that still happens
hahah, "answer to housing discrimination? speak with a british accent"
i think its not so easy, thats all i'm saying
and i just have to forge hep's will and kill her
hepkitten: promise to throw me some scraps of meat now and then?
hahaha
my parents are leaving me a debt when they die, and probably part of my grandparents debt
so first i gotta hustle a new identity
i dont really know how it works, but yeah
well like, if they leave a house to you
you cant just let it sit there if there is outstanding debt on the mortgage
or 8th re-mortgage
i'm not sure how it works, all i know is my grandparents owned a home that was worthless and broken all down and shit but it was paid off
and my parents had to deal with it all or they risked being sued by someone
ohio
haha
ok i found out another depressing thing about home ownership which i think i knew but forgot
your monthly mortgage payment is directly related to your down payment
and unless you have a really good down payment its prolly 3-4 times your current rent payment
hmm
also, re: bush is http://stray.linefeed.org/
hitler had a good dog
he started the tradition
http://www.thirdreichruins.com/overlook2.jpg
Sherrod: half the reason israel exists is to get the jews out of europe
hahah you're more liberal than i am
english.aljazeera.net is back online
at least it is giving the uswa some more backbone
but that labor market is too powerful for anyone to want to save it
a relic of mid-20th century strong unions
bush is doing all he can to salvage the u.s. economy
a budget deficit wont matter if the spoils of iraq war can go through the u.s.
Oh yeah and also I just watched the full police video of the dude who died in Cincinnati.
Those cops were completely in the right using the force they did. He was coked up and lumbering after them.
My verdict: NOT GUILTY. If Cincinnati riots, it's just looking for a reason to riot.
:(
those cops should be fired immediately
thats just some thing i read somewhere
mental health workers deal with lumbering psychotics every day
they dont kill them
they just know how to do their jobs
Encapsulate: maybe they should be replaced with them, then
someone who can handle the job
Encapsulate: no gun was needed in this situation
"a man is having a psychotic episode -- should we send people trained to deal with it, or shoudl we send the racist murderers?"
"lets send the murderers"
i know
the same police force that had official visitors from the "nationalist movement" in mississippi
no, the point this other person was making is that the guy was coked up and on pcp
i.e. having a psychotic episode on drugs
kingmob: but yes, cinci cops are among the most arrogant bastards you will find
and have an openly racist culture
really just biased against anyone who isnt a white power paramilitary jackoff like they are
white, black, whatever, doesnt matter
hahahah
kingmob++
exactly
agreed
?
we actually NEED mcdonalds workers and gas station attendants
they provide a positive service to society
hehe
the only wacky claim i've heard is that if you do cocaine outside, you deserve to die
i disagree with kingmob, though
because i do not believe that hanging is a torturous enough death
toast: ohio
kingmob: ok, you convinced me
kill him!!
its one of those drug addicts!!
but kingmob
you know this keith fangman fellow?
a real piece of work
he just quit being president of the cinci fraternal order of police
underneath his blue uniform is a white sheet
literally
yep
yeah, a good guy
jim mcnamara
columbus copwatch basically sustained itself through lawsuits
anyway, what i was saying was whenever the last $5000 copwatch settlement ran out, another one would be arriving
that worked for like 2 or 3 years
but now i'm back to working at my job
where doing my job means doing lethal amounts of cocaine and rampaging in the white castle parking lot
jej: you campaigned for my return?!
sure but did you have to get consensus or did you act unilaterally?
incredible
well i mostly just wanted to finish my thought
here's last year:
http://sf.indymedia.org/uploads/burnflag.jpg
this one wasnt as impressive:
http://sf.indymedia.org/uploads/burnflag1.jpg
i took the first one
and that is way cooler than yours
me me me
i just drank 8 cops of coffee
er cups even
OK
i cant believe more movies arent made about ne oio
it sounds stupid though
ohio too
ne ohio
there's a movie being made about the cleveland black panthers
yeah but they arent race riots, they're class war riots
and did you know that in the 60s riots in cincinnati, the early formations of redneck militias took up sniper positions to defend police-free zones in black neighborhoods
i just did
and they didnt get wiped out until the mid-90s
well, some of the white people were behind the revolutionary vanguard
but thats all according to plan
behind == hadnt caught up yet 
yeah, thats intentional
ohio has always been like that, the underground railroad ended there
california is still way more segregated and institutionally racist than ohio is
even though ohio has more of a reputation of that, i imagine
to me, it is.. everywhere i ever lived in ohio was racially integrated
and here i dont find many black neighborhoods with white minorities
and i dont see as many poor white neighborhoods in the cities here
i think they are out in the non-city areas
its different because in the south, it is overt
and here you dont find overt racism like that
you find institutional racism
sure, but that will always happen
well i think the difference is that in ohio, wealth stratification is different
where you have a small, small group of people controlling old wealth
and a lot of poor slobs who dont have jack, black and white
whereas in california there is wealth for upwardly mobile yuppies
well my view is more than just cleveland
because i lived in cleveland, akron, suburbs of akron, columbus, dayton and cincinnati
well, i dunno. dayton is completely segregated, east is redneck, west is black
but i think any area where most people worked at one factory, or two factories..
those areas are integrated in a way unlike other parts of the country
because you have so many people in the exact same financial situation
and by factory, i mean mill, which are like the size of cities
thats why i'm saying, ohio in general
the world is bigger than brisbane, hep
FIX IT SLOW ASS
i know
they should have tortured him first :(
hello? ohio is a big important state
with MANY IMPORTANT CULTURAL CONTRIBUTIONS
joan jett for instance
the problem with the death penalty is the criminal justice system is so fucked up
once you kill someone you cant let them out and let them sue the state for years lost
but this abortion doctor, fuck em
in my opinion, the criminal justice system is almost always wrong
Fahrvergnugen: a good point when i made it ten minutes ago in one sentence
either way, this guy is an unrepetent political assassin
i agree, dealth penalty for the military industrial establishment
does that mean its time to switch from american to middle east politics? :)
NOW what?!
Encapsulate: i would hurry up with it if i were you
there are plenty of jews who would be offended if you said that zionism = judaism
its like saying that all muslims are taliban fundamentalists
then whats the point? you cant criticize zionism without being labeled anti-semitic
which is exactly what zionists want, to ride off the back of jews everywhere who may or may not support their fundamentalist fanaticism
hep can take the moderate approach, i will continue to content that a political philosophy which is religious fundamentalism should be compared to nazism more often
Encapsulate: in the US, i would agree that's the current climate
Encapsulate: anywhere else in the world understands that the US government supports modern-day genocidal fascists in the middle east
Encapsulate: again, in the US, i agree thats the climate
Encapsulate: but what is the message? "we have sensitivity for nazis, we just think you should vote against them" or something? honestly, that doesnt work
Encapsulate: yes but nazis are the #1 reason for the existence of israel, it isnt like you are pulling it out of nowhere in this context, re: godwin
hahah, either way, *i* dont use that term.. i prefer nazionist
Encapsulate: i mean, thats nice and all, but who cares?
Encapsulate: people arent using the term just to sway *you*
Encapsulate: not really, a lot of it is just information sharing amongst people already doing something
Encapsulate: that's the #1 thing indymedia is for
Sherrod: news has different target demographics, etc
Encapsulate: either way, the point re: google news is that this article wasnt meant to be for google news ANYWAY, its not "hate speech" and google is inconsistent in its censorship
re: everything i already wrote
Sherrod: the guidelines arent listed, i dont think
Encapsulate: thats a ridiculous generalization, and if you argue that, then Jerusalem Post needs to go, NY Post needs to go, etc
Sherrod: your site doesnt qualify because you dont have a team of editors doing review
Sherrod: whereas indymedia has hundreds of editors
Sherrod: your abusive boyfriend doesnt count :/
Encapsulate: because "thugs" should only be used to describe terrorists or carjackers, right?
Encapsulate: in a "civilized media" ?
alternet is good and we have a solid relationship with them, but it serves a different purpose
deimos: alternet itself doesnt write much of anything, they syndicate professional writers with a liberal slant
haha, either way, ny post gets to call palestinians thugs, we get to call abusive police thugs
either way, i REALLY have to go to work
Encapsulate: i pay attention to the news that tells it like is, and thats why indymedia is insanely popular
Encapsulate: because it isnt your normal liberal mamby-pamby whining
Encapsulate: it is militant hard left
right
and you arent
so we have to hear your liberal whining :)
no, we identify more people who are militant
hahah, just the success of indymedia proves that wrong
people are sick of leftists without a backbone
name-calling proves your point
why dont you call me a wackonazi?
haha, exactly
hahah, either way, *i* dont use that term.. i prefer nazionist
hahah, either way, *i* dont use that term.. i prefer nazionist 
 its whackonazi
get it right
hi
ooh commie land? 
where is that?
 Church officials gave reporters copies of a recent e-mail sent to bishops by a man identified as David Lewis of Manchester, Vermont, claiming that Robinson touched him improperly "a couple of years ago" and calling him a "grab-assing skirt-chaser."
its because the cease fire condition is all prisoners released
then the middle ground is that political prisoners are released, if not all prisoners
then israel made a list on their own and said: this is who we are releasing
so palestinian side is saying that violates the cease fire
i think israel is afraid to release all the prisoners because many of them are experienced guerrilla fighters
also, israel does not have committed troops
few israelis are ready to kill themselves to kill palestinians
there are fundamentalist religious types on both sides who believe that is their ancestral land
thats because the israelis live in comfort like americans, and thus mostly try not to think about it
thats why suicide bombers like to hit hipster discos
because israel is a colonial state and a proxy for western interests in an area that is vitally important to world politics
it will be less important if iraq can be made into a proxy state for the US
and it is a clear contemporary example of the united states openly supporting ethnic cleansing
but the palestinian resistance isnt so hopeless.. like last year, they had 7 suicide bombings in 7 days
and hamas says they have enough bombers for the next 20 years
the israeli population just wont be able to stomach too much more of that
mirth: why?
desperate to the extent that living in a refugee camp the rest of your life isnt the most appealing thing ever
but strategically the israeli civilian population cant take much more of it
guerrilla warfare works, there's plenty of examples
its the only way to beat an enemy that has outrageous military strength
israel doesnt do that because they cant
because palestine would bomb them to heaven
so it isnt restraint, it is just realizing their limitations
the entire israeli civilian population lives on fear and paranoia about bombers
there have been so many bombings since this intifada started
i know i would be afraid, regardless of what the leadership had to say
i disagree, the world population mostly doesnt care
where was the world opinion during the first intifada which was mostly peaceful protest?
so most palestinians are resigned to winning through military victory now
people always underestimate the ability for guerrillas to win a war
but they almost always win :)
but the military goals are so disparate
israel has to kill the will of palestinians to keep fighting
all palestinians have to do is kill the will to support the right-wing fundamentalists in israeli society
which already happened with rabin, until he was assassinated by the israeli right-wing
now *that* is listening too much to the israeli leadership
not really, the radicals (being the muslim groups and communist groups) want a one-state solution
but most recognize that right of return for israelis is an acceptable part of that
seems fair to me
i think thats fair -- israel as a state doesnt exist anymore, palestine is all that land with a secular government
no, they dont need to be conquered
just the civilian population has to be convinced that it isnt worth their while to keep defending the zionist wingnuts

its because there are 4 terrorists on the loose today
 El Shukrijumah occasionally wears a beard. He has a pronounced nose and is asthmatic.
not only that ... but he has many aliases

but still, its good to be informed
Michigan High School Class Angers Some Parents: it's not the topic that's angered some students' parents. It's the class readings, many of which come from left-wing Web sites like Alternet.org, Indymedia.org, Progressive.org and War-times.org
"This belief that we have to show that every concept out of that society can be understood and excused is really a problem across the country," said Farmington father Don Cohen.

ever since the tinker decision, they've done everything they can to erode it and its never gone back
there are lots of reports of civilian/children casualties that the u.s. doesnt confirm
so who knows
hlprmnky: except almost every "terrorist" group always claims credit for attacks which kills civilians
hamas are just honest folks, i guess
the fact that the u.s. rejects any responsibility in international war crimes puts them far behind most contemporary regimes i think
hahah, jesus
hamas behaves like that because their strategy is destroying civilian support for the war
i.e. you dont care when you arent dying, but when your busses blow up maybe you care what your govt does
its a proven military strategy
but the u.s. is reknowned for rejecting war crimes prosecutions against them
nicaragua is the best example i think
   
madcow fc milan, italy
i know tons of people there, but they probably cant get anyone work
unless they want to do framing on new construction
ohio hasnt really been known as a good job market for a few decades now
but really, new construction is the answer

possibly even save some money, too
for framing you need to know what you are doing or you might kill someone

i like cut and paste with history
hep is a liar
cj_: i have never had a problem installing kde from ports
but it does take a long time
pfft
based on hep's cat/dogs policy, you can easily see how her kde bloatware position loses all credibility
hep, Uncle Jack is the proper noun and NYC is part of a prepositional phrase
thats my vote
isnt the confusion that the book says *the* proper noun and hep thinks there is more than one proper noun?
but prepositional phrases get separated out and so there is still only one proper noun, even though New York City is a proper noun
sure, but if the book is asking you which is *the* proper noun
hahah
WRITE SMALL
he did this:
http://www.liberty-belles.org/images/shame/davisguns2.jpg
he's just a professional bureaucrat, so he's done a ton of terrible things to people of all political persuasions
but you could say that about any long-standing govt bureaucrat
anybody could get recalled if the republicans decided to fund a recall effort, though
i'm amazed how those petitions are portrayed in the media though
literally, you go to a company, hire them to get signatures, and they find every wino to go out and do it
sure, and so they get way more signatures than they actually need to deal with people who actually arent voters but signed 
its really the screw, though, which is that voter initiatives, referendums or recalls *seem* democratic
but the only people who can make them happen are rich powerful interests
Sherrod: arianna huffington is a good libertarian recall candidate
like her?
yeah but she is pretty close to libertarian, although she has some left-leaning things
when has government not been a complete mess?
if you have a fleet of F-16s for instance, people will kill to control it
s/F-16s/chariots/
etc
is that when the rich people celebrated their freedom to oppress people on their own, rather than oppress people on behalf of the king?
i'd love the usa if it was a memory in the past
its because slimy, corrupt republicans bought and paid for a recall
a recall for a slimy, corrupt democrat
thats american politics

but this was an upscale place and i thought it was strange
they had IRA books in the same bookshelf, but i guess thats ok now as long as it doesnt say "real ira"
there is also strong support for the IRA in the bay area
they always have IRA people come and there are protests against the terrorists
but they come and are welcomed by the city anyway

horse owners are sick, sick people
William Shatner's ex-wife has sued him for breach of contract over breeding privileges of three American saddlebred stallions.
The lawsuit says that until this breeding season, the ''Star Trek" star provided Lafferty the semen of one of the horses, Great Day's Came the Son, in ''fresh cooled format." In March, the lawsuit says, Lafferty learned the breeding privileges from that horse and two other stallions would be in the form of frozen semen.

bonus points because cj wanted to hit on my narc
mm will the democrats invest the money into recalling arnold, or will they give up california
maybe they can paul wellstone him
no but there will be exit polls towards the evening
the elections in US are so fixed that exit polls are the least concern i think
the evidence is just the disproportionate impact campaign spending has on your ability to win
aside from that, is the ballot fraud in most major cities like SF, chicago, miami where it is just common knowledge
aside from that is the corruption of places like the media and those who put on the debates
the ballet isnt fair either
i could have been a star :(
i think prop l would have passed
at the very least
but then macromedia people would be in jail instead of illegally moving to a new building
prop l strengthened enforcement of existing building codes, in part
and during the dot com boom, there was tons of zoning violations
like, kick a bunch of long term residents out because an illegally zoned office is moving in and its employees want to live in the vicinity
its like willie brown said: getting kicked out of your home under rent control you've had for 20 years is an opportunity
but the owners cant afford to sell unles they violate zoning laws
this happens everywhere
it was perfected in nyc under giuliani
sf has unique laws but what we're describing was really created in the 90s under giuliani
there was a literal war over it and people fought with police in riots over it for 6 years
so, initiatives and recalls could be tools of democracies, but in the US it just means that wealthy people can now use their money to hijack everything
but we should go in the tunnels
hahaha it underestimates the customers' desire to waste food rather than feel they got ripped off

i dont even think that thing about the sauds flying out of the country is accurate
... that, there was something uniquely suspicious about them flying out of the country on the 18th

*now* will you help me overthrow the govt

ooh arnold victory speech soon!
i'm watching it on cnn webcast
oops, no i'm not, you have to pay

africa is poor because of scumbags like arnold in the us govt
scumbags like grey davis, also, but thats beside the point
austin: thats a joke, right?
well if it wasnt for the damn anti-american liberals i could live in apartheid south africa
remember how good that was?
no politics tonight?
they expected 10 million
and that was more than usual
in some countries you have to vote under penalty of law
As many as 10 million California voters will cast ballots in the recall, 30 percent more than voted in the governor's race last year 
sine: its based on projections and exit polling
sine: they are almost never wrong
and the ballots are closed, so who cares
sine: that would mean in areas not reporting, everyone lied in the exit poll
sine: possible, but not enough to stop anyone from calling the election
sine: it is sometimes, i agree, but only if the ballots arent closed
sine: they all waited until 8pm PST this time, based on what happened in the presidential election
anyway, they get away with outrageous things everyday
and no one cares
why should this be different?
between nov 15 and nov 25, arnold takes office
also, u.s. legitimizes bombing of syria today
what the fuck are people thinking?!
austin_: syria thing is top news all over the world
austin_: except when you ride in a car or buy things subsidized by us aggression
the issue with syria isnt wmd, its their support of palestinian resistance
which is terrorism in the u.s., not most of the world though
they fucking published a map of damascus showing all the places they are going to bomb
not in the us but people are fkn noticing everywhere else
israel wants another regional war and they can do it because the us can do anything there now
what u.s. politician doesnt get money from special interests?
i just think "special interests" is something made up by republicans who dont consider huge corporations to be special interests
and so if you are for unions or minority groups or whatever, you are a slave to special interests

AGAIN
hahahah
i know nikito

he's italian
he did
now he lives in canada
incidentally, in spanish irc jej is heh
it has more to do with the 30,000 people killed by the USA during the dirty war in argentina
SO THERE
nikito finds it hard to ever shut up about anything

hi
probably the most important thing to farmworkers is free trade, same thing for farm owners but in reverse
both republican or democrat have the same position on that
but either way, there is just no information in those parts of the state besides abc/nbc/fox/etc
in the city you have more access to information
arnold will just not be the kind of governor that drives everything
he will be the PR front man while real politicians tell him what to do
common sense
the entire recall, support for arnold, etc is engineered by a faction of republicans
you think the recall was a spontaneous uprising of discontented voters?
except this one had the money to hire people to collect signatures
how is that bullshit? thats exactly what happened
yes
have you noticed the record-breaking fundraising done by george bush since 911?
those signatures are paid for
you hire a company, they hire homeless people, and you get the signatures
they were, and they traditionally overshoot the #s they need to compensate
it isnt a conspiracy
i've personally been involved with hiring these companies for campaigns
its how its done
you might notice people standing outside target or something, you think they are going to sparechange you 
but then they ask you for a signature for the petition
do you honestly believe those are committed political recall activists?
the point is the recall was bankrolled
it was bankrolled by a faction of republicans
and thus, it took this long to overcome your earlier "BULLSHIT"
right, republicans have way more money now after 911 fundraising
record-breaking fundraising happened in the jingoism after 911
engineered nonetheless
its not a secret
i couldnt even have a discussion with someone who thinks arnie is anything more than a frontman for pete wilson's faction of california republicans
no, i know.. when they have those campaign planning meetings, arnold does all the talking and pete listens intently for guidance
here's an example of it in use with a group that has loose process from a bunch of different continents..

yes, well according to kismet people, fbsd wireless drivers return spotty and incorrect data
ok ok listen
dachb0den == bsd airtools == dstumbler
those dont work in 5.1
where those = that because its all the same things
AND all the normal wireless tools dont work because fbsd wireless drivers are below even the obsd wireless drivers
below them on a scale of workingness
ok! what program do you use for wardriving?
now we're getting somewhere
[11:09] <dragorn> The freebsd driver developers don't care
[11:10] <dragorn> so no, as far as I know, there hasn't been any progress
[11:11] <dragorn> As far as I can determine the drivers don't report complete packets for data and mangle the hell out of the rest
yeah, i wanted something nice
my point is not to get help, it is to mock freebsd
because that other channel got me in the mock freebsd mood

t12: what are you going for?
t12: a friend of mine was going to get community service, but he said he couldnt do it
t12: so then they downgraded it for him to write a 5000-word letter to george bush explaining why he opposes the war in iraq
t12: but he's a juvenile so that's probably why. either way he sent george bush a 5000-word speech by joseph stalin about why people should oppose u.s. imperialism
i'd rather write a letter than serve time or pay something
traffic or public assembly violations ... they have more time and money than you do, so you cant really win
just get off as light as possible and get on with life
t12: for that arrest, they have like an 80-page document all about how many weapons were found there, etc
t12: then they try to bump up your charge
t12: then they make you plea because you'd rather do that than deal with bigger charges
t12: ... based on other people i know who have gone to court for that 7th and mission thing
anyway, if you are in a violent mob its incumbent on you to not be part of it
t12: they really havent been dropping those charges, they do what i said, threaten to escalate them and then get you to plea
i didnt know that.. 
oh, i mean 7th mission people
t12: um, yeah i dont know anyone who has not pled
but, you might want to check with the ella baker center
they *were* doing a class action lawsuit about that arrest
but they were mostly looking for people with injuries
to be part of that suit, you must plead not guilty
ella baker center is filled with attorneys
actually, i'm supposed to go there this week for something else so i can ask them what their status is
well, if you do end up making a big deal out of it, let me know because it would be fun to publicize that
sure, i think most protest arrests are like that
but if you factor that time = money then you still lose

i wore a fkn snowsuit the whole time
http://images.indymedia.org/imc/cancun/image/10/omc_naked.jpg
the only semi-violent clashes so far is when they wouldnt let 15 buses from chiapas in
in case you were wondering
but there was a lot of fighting at the last ministerial in cancun
there will be so many now that they tried to assassinate the founder of hamas
hahah, maybe the higher oil prices are because the new pipelines out of iraq keep getting sabotaged?
grog reopening???
GIVE IT UP
its hard to keep an irc client up :(
its hard to keep a box up :(
this is also hep's fault
WHAT WERE YOU SAYING BILLF??
so yah irc.indymedia.org #insub
its available if you all need it
hm, but isnt it true that there are groups in the world who want to violently oppose u.s. policy?
i think the argument is, people out there already hate us, we should destroy them before they are strong enough to seriously attack us
the only other answer is to significantly change u.s. policy
and that would significantly change the quality of life in the u.s.
sure, but i think its more than just paying more for gas
like for instance, americans might have to care about politics :)
but the u.s. isnt like europe, with a lot of social infrastructure..
if the dollar really collapsed or we lost our ability to enforce economic inequity, the u.s. could look like brazil or colombia
i'm just saying that bush/cheney arent stupid
yawn
mmm dubai
did you know the world's only seven-star hotel is in dubai?
look how nice it is:
http://funny.wox.org:8080/greatstructures/burj.jpg
and to get from the restaurant to the hotel part of it, you ride in a converted soviet submarine
you know what is news though?
The FCC has ruled that Stern's syndicated radio show is a "bona fide news interview" program.
That means that Stern can put Arnold Schwarzenegger on the air, without having to offer time to the scores of other candidates in the California recall election.
and it is kind of a conspiracy since the fcc commissioner is colin powell's son
but someday we'll figure it out, everyone -- what is and isnt news?
we know two things -- howard stern is and indymedia isnt
so we're getting close
aml: conspiracy theorist
Fahrvergnugen: you missed the naked protester pictures last night
Fahrvergnugen: hahah, is indymedia for terrorists or hippies?
PICK A GENERALIZATION AND STICK WITH IT
Fahrvergnugen: truly profound
i like pickup trucks, dogs, koit and kpoo radio, and model railroads
yeah, he's a black lab/german shepherd
who the hell are you talking about?
looking for pictures..
the real thing is people are forced to choose between two people who wont make that much of a difference because only the richest people have a chance
which isnt really a democracy, its more of an oligarchy, and a lot of leftists have a problem with that
but not the people Fahrvergnugen is talking about, a race of people known as the strawmen
lots of leftists push for all kinds of legislation
lots more dont think it can be fixed with legislation, etc
not really interested in defending a generalized group of leftists anyways
as far as i know the liberals will face the wrath of the red terror just like all the other scumbags
well, i cant find a picture of my dog online
bruno (someone else named him but it stuck)
i got him at an animal shelter in ohio
he was like 6 weeks old and really timid, he wouldnt even lift up his head
i had to carry him out
now he's better but still kind of timid, but he barks a lot when people come to the door and he's protective when you're out and about
Sherrod: he's like 7
Fahrvergnugen: *please* tell me what i can do to make you listen to me
Fahrvergnugen: *now* are you trying to be profound? 
Fahrvergnugen: hahah, believe me, i never figured malice when i wondered why you were going on like that
Fahrvergnugen: i was being sarcastic, i honestly dont care what you think or have any interest in convincing you of anything
i just really think neither of you know much about me at all, ever asked me what i meant when i was giving my opinion on something, you just went off and immediately said i was a turban-wearing johnny walker
sure, i'm just saying why i dont care what Fahrvergnugen has to say
and capitalized nicks are the dumbest fucking thing ever
anyway, i gotta go to lunch
ok, *if its your name*
now if you'll excuse me, going to lunch gives me a chance to pass out pro-terror pamphlets and preach to my coworkers
i think the joke/stereotype has always been that the black platoons lead the charge
but without a doubt its class that has always determined who goes to fight
besides those recruiters openly lie
every week a different branch would be in my high school's cafeteria
and they openly tell you there are no wars, there will be no wars, you can sign up in a way where you wont see combat, etc
how about that anti-capitalist anti-wto suicide today, huh?
http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/030910/168/58g4z.html
told you those koreans meant business
there's a lot of street fighting so far, actually
better than the last cancun ministerial because the protesters got their asses kicked
this time they are fighting back better
plus, the suicide.. its hard for mass media to ignore that

the wto is generally hated as one of the main organizations pushing free trade / neoliberalism on the world
which is seen as overt imperialism
http://cancun.mediosindependientes.org/media/all/display/280
http://images.indymedia.org/imc/cancun/image/6/large/bardaomcchavo.jpg
not bad
no matter how much you pay those protesters, they won't throw a fence on a line of riot police
anyway, they have paid protesters who do attack police
the protesters in venezuela when the u.s. attempted a coup there recently
i think it was halliburton :)
whoa, you're from chillicothe?
you know.. i know this woman who was arrested in chillicothe
becauses they have that big christmas tree in the center of town
and one year she put a chain around the bottom and attached it to her pickup truck and drove away with it

anyone know where we can get nice new rackmounted servers for cheap?
no, we hate liberals
anti-capitalist servers
well, yes
know anywhere good?
currently only one of the servers is stolen
all the rest have come from failing companies
i think that janky servers is a big cause for why companies fail
its a joke, i.e. all of the servers we got from failing companies are bad

parents, do you know what your anti-american beliefs are doing to your kids??
Two students at Oakland High School were interrogated last month by the U.S. Secret Service after allegedly threatening the life of President Bush in a classroom discussion, school officials have confirmed.
"(The Secret Service agent) asked me if I knew my rights, and I said no. Then he said that I'm not going to even tell you your rights because of what you said. ? That was a threat to the government. You are owned by us now, you're owned by the government. If you lie I'm going to take you to federal prison and you're just going to be sitting there and your parents won't know about it."
patriotic fear-mongering?
http://sf.indymedia.org/news/2003/05/1607366.php
http://www.sfbayview.com/050703/homelandsecurity050703.shtml
no no, that part was me, adding patriotic fear-mongering
i dunno, isnt it more insidious to harrass somebody's kids, then you want to protect your kids, then you shut up more with your anti-american crap
i'm saying, what is the impact of something like that? probably that it chills free thought and now any family that has kids in that school will watch what they say more
i guess, i would imagine security professionals would understand that some high school kids arent really a sniper threat to the president
haha, i doubt those kids knew where washington dc was on a map, let alone be a threat to the president
the columbine kids, i mean
you think its the job of the SS to intimidate anyone who might remotely be construed as a threat?
ok.. i think there is a credibility threshold and unless that is crossed, the SS needs to act less like thugs, more like professionals
the real thing is SS agents asking political questions is the least of oakland public schools law enforcement problems
they still have those OPD stations in the high schools
we had cops come to my school a lot but they didnt have a fkn office there
SR?
anyways, what kind of society do we live in when we cant talk about killing elected officials?
:(
you can only say things like "that george bush, i hope someone tells him off and really hurts his feelings"
but thats it
personally i wish nothing but longevity and good health to the president and his family
and if dick cheney's heart stops, i pray the defibrillator kicks in and revives him

hello
this mayor debate is so boring
at least in person matt calls him a rich brat
cowards!
most protest in the US has the effect of complaining because any serious dissent is violently eliminated while most people have their thumbs up their asses
and for people in the world who are serious about it, the u.s. kills them and then they marvel at the medal of honor winners who did the killing
austin, i like clinton?
your problem is being presumptuous
always presuming and assuming
shouldnt you be receiving your patriotism training on pbs?
but to answer your question, rob
there was a huge general strike in san francisco and seattle
and then not really general strikes but big steel belt strikes in michigan, ohio and etc
oh and oakland had a general strike too
i'd be all for a general strike but you need unions to do it
and u.s. unions arent so good anymore
thats no goon
thats a medal of honor in the making

my friend was obsessive about tracking what they said and when it later got confirmed by other media
yeah but this is chechen

tamara, does canada have an embassy building in kuwait city, or does it just have an office?
tamara: why doe it say kuwait/qatar all over the website?
isnt there a separate diplomatic thing for qatar?
what is that, some cost-saving thing for the canadian govt?
i see
are there indians who do all the shitwork at the canadian embassy?
*shrug* arent they non-citizens?
i'm just curious, thats all
i imagine there is a large portion of kuwaiti residents woh arent granted citizenship
thats how most of those states are
because usually these noncitizens do the shitwork in those states
or, any state, really, non-legal people do the worst jobs
but its pretty pronounced in gulf states
or, any state, really, non-legal people do the worst jobs
right, sure, thats what i meant
the slaves :/
did you have to evacuate during the war?
its better than starving to death in southern india
you can say that
any chance your dad will have a life-changing shift in perception and break off diplomatic relations with kuwait until the canadian govt can scramble up a new ambassador?
that'd be big news
nope
suicide bomber in irael 
er israel
and another separate bomb
tamara: is she lebanese?
faisal: israel is too afraid to do anything
and they should be
they could easily take out hezbollah's positions
but then they would have real problems
well i gotta go to bed
consider voluntary kidnapping
it would be quite an incident if right-wing israeli terrorists kidnapped the ambassador to kuwait's daughter
it could be this whole staged thing
THINK ABOUT IT
eh, they're too busy researching new and better ways to slant drill
night
i dont think dennis cunningham will take your ticket case :)

good morning
rupert murdoch openly brags about enforcing a right-wing slant on news/commentary
search google for rupert murdoch?
oh hm, i thought you were kidding
rupert murdoch is openly political, i think he calls himself libertarian
but he's openly anti-communist and tries to buy up markets in communist or semi-communist regions
he calls himself a "catalyst for change,"  thats his famous quote
and if you want stories of reporters resigning from murdoch's company, you can find them a dime a dozen, more than most places
well a news person who has an open political bias and then brags about buying into markets ..?
yeah
yeah, china
its big news, searching for murdoch china would certainly bring it up right away
and then the other big scandal is his close personal relationship with ariel sharon
http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=murdoch+china&btnG=Google+Search
*shrug*
i thought it was pretty obvious fox is a right-wing news channel
i guess not :(
my point is that murdoch is egregious about conflicts of interest
i told you how
for instance, he's open about being personal friends with ariel sharon
have you SEEN fox new's coverage of israel?
ok, but CNN's politics are more complicated, for instance, their coverage of israel has changed a bit since that arab magnate got such a huge investment in CNN
and since ted turner left
i would say murdoch is by far the most egregious about flaunting his conflicts of interest and openly having a strong political bias
everyhere is a famous recent case:
er s/everyhere/here/
Murdoch?s close relationship with Sharon and heavy investment in Israel led former Times Africa correspondent Sam Kiley to resign his position. ?The Times foreign editor and other middle managers flew into hysterical terror every time a pro-Israel lobbying group wrote in with a quibble or complaint,? Kiley said, ?and then usually took [the lobby?s] side against their own correspondent...No pro-Israel lobbyist ever dreamed of having such power 
After one conversation in which Kiley was asked not to mention a 12-year-old Palestinian boy who was killed by Israeli troops, the reporter ?was left wordless, so I quit.?
http://www.wrmea.com/archives/june2003/0306024.html
anyway
i gotta go to work really, proving that rupert murdoch is right-wing is just making me depressed
hahahah
just for fun i went to foxnews and searched for israel
top story?
"Twin Homicide Bombers Rock Israel"
note foxnews style guide makes them be called homicide bombers
even though everyone in the world calls them suicide bombers
who asks for them to be called homicide bombers?
michael savage, rush limbaugh, etc
for example
ok off to work
er, the point is that "homicide bomber" is not a term used outside of right-wing american circles
and rush limbaugh et al went on a campaign to start having them be called "homicide bombers" because "suicide bomber" got them too much sympathy
so agree or not, it shows bias at fox news
yes that too
but we cant even get to fox news is right-wing :/
of course they do
i mean if you blow yourself up to end a military occupation of your home, maybe you deserve some sympathy?
i know it isnt as heroic as the cowards hiding in tanks, but still ..
they aren't suicide bombers
they are Explosion Bombers

The DPRK will increase its self-defensive capacity strong enough to destroy aggressors at a single stroke.
this has been the biggest 24 hours of anti-americanism in weeks
The Institute of Plant Resources under the Academy of Agricultural Science of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has developed a health drink for computer operators. The drink, with Saponin extracted from fruits of a tree as its main ingredient, has a good effect on the prevention of and recovery from fatigue.
hi
ITS THE FRUIT OF THE TREE
unbeliever
alright lets hear it then
its not nice to call them cowards :(
there must be more secrets or something
well i hate those secrets
i want different ones
If the U.S. persists in its moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK, turning away from the just and principled stand of the Korean people, it will suffer another shameful defeat before the world.
"If the U.S., their henchmen and followers dare unleash a war against the DPRK, the Korean people and revolutionary armed forces will never miss the opportunity to plunge the provokers into a sea of fire and to reduce them to ashes.

hey mw
can you shed any light into how google handles multiple domains that go to a single website?
how it picks which one is the dominant domain to spider?
www.sf.indymedia.org vs. sf.indymedia.org vs. *.indymedia.org
except the obvious thing is that tons of sites link to sf.indymedia.org
site that link to sf.indymedia.org - 19,700
site that link to www.sf.indymedia.org - 195
there is no reason why they would give preference to www.sf.indymedia.org
www.sf.indymedia.org cname's sf.indymedia.org
so for instance, you search for "sf.indymedia.org"
and the first result is "www.sf.indymedia.org"
not with the site: prefix
just searching for the domain name
yes, but you can if you are trying to figure things out
ben, search with it in quotes of course
the domain by itself gives you the site
i'm just interested in figuring it
signal-to-noise, insub :(
ok since the non-political google conversation was no good

that DIDNT EVEN HAPPEN you liars
did they show that soldier getting dragged in the movie?
The Tallahassee chapters of Veterans for Peace and the Vietnam Veterans Against the War, were literally "yanked" from the from the parade line by Tallahassee police.
in related news, Tallahassee soldier killed by bomb in Iraq
"Robert was doing what he liked to do," Wise's mother, Tammy Wise of Tallahassee, said in a statement released through the National Guard. "He believed in what he was doing and I'm very proud of him."
al gore?
"He was a remarkable young man, a go-getter," said Senior Master Sgt. Stephen Sullivan.
dont see the connection
either way, tallahassee is in florida and al gore is scumbag
al gore helped get that aforementioned soldier dragged through the streets 
they are afraid the US will be like every other country
where you can buy any movie you want on a street corner
you can already do that in the mission sometimes
and at those bart fleamarkets
10 seconds to download a movie?
i think the laws are specifically to stop black markets from happening in the US
which seems reasonable to me from their perspective
i'm all for pirating and ripping them off
but i dont think they are unreasonable for trying to fight it
t12: you prefer movie industry private armies like they've got in russia?
we need those black markets like they have in brazil and the middle east
more convenient than searching around on some filesharing thing forever
where you can go and buy any commercial software for like $1.50
hahah, the real reason black markets wont develop in the US :P
but its faster to go spend $10 somewhere rather than spend a million years trying to download photoshop and a bunch of other things off p2p, isnt it?
i dont know but last time i tried to find, say, photoshop it took forever and then the download never finished, etc
a good friend was detained for 3 weeks last year under similar circumstances
2 weeks in solitary confinement at INS
he's from dubai
yeah, thats why most families arent doing anything about the disappearances
i mean, they dont even really have to say that they have the people
so they are afraid that they'll be killed or something while in detention
india, hmm
i see
they still dont even know which federal agency arrested my friend
he was taken away by FBI agents
but he was put in an INS detention facility
the weird part is that he thinks he might have been drugged and then taken back to his house with FBI agents at his side
they told him they took him there so he could "get some things" but he doesnt remember saying that, and he remembers feeling groggy and strange when they did it
anyway, the FBI investigated everyone he knows too
and followed his sister around for like a month
she lives in SF

any bright ideas on how i can easily concatenate all these files into one big file?
cj_: excellent
find + exec is always the answer to my problems
hm, that find thing had bigfile.txt at 5GB before i cancelled it, when there is only 13MB of text files
no
ah, maybe that is it actually
heh
right
i'm sure that was it
thanks :)
does your dad have any other houses?

lucky, t12
i always thought if i had a free ride like that i would work just as much as i do now
save up like a million dollars
and then really be able to do the things i try to do when i'm not at work
its a necessity
you dont work to have money, you work so you arent screwed
a few times in my adult life i've hit $0 in my bank account
its not pretty
one time i did this scam with my best friends dad
stealing jewelry from joann's fabrics when they gave cash for returns
we made like $800
but then we got caught and he's still in prison for it
but he was a repeat offender
but that was one time i ran out of money completely
it was quicker than waiting 3 weeks for your first paycheck
three weeks with $0 is a long time
anyway i'm tired and this is depressing
good night

Now, you tell me why the media continues to present these types of attacks as acceptable protests.  These are criminal acts, pure and simple.  They should be reported and roundly condemned as such.
           Animal rights activists vandalized a new Sonoma Plaza restaurant, also damaging two adjacent businesses, in what police called an act of ''domestic terrorism.'' 
''Clearly they're sophisticated,'' Sonoma Police Chief John Gurney said of the suspects
One Internet account of the night visit to Jaubert's home described ''torture'' involved in the production of foie gras, in which ''workers shove large metal pipes down throats of ducks four times a day for three to four weeks and pump them full of massive quantities of food to enlarge their livers to eight to nine times their natural size for foie gras.''

PAGING BILLF
 but its legal to protect your property while someone is stealing it
like, if someone is rifling through your corporate dumpster it is legal to penalize them by throwing their ass out or detaining them
you could easily break someone's hands or inflict bodily harm on them however you want
if its in the process of protecting your property
so its ok for me to break into someone's house and get a glass of water?
they still have water
but it meets the logic of "if i take a glass of water from you, you still have water"
the point is that intellectual property is still property and arguments about the way you steal it is irrelevant
now, i personally believe that all property is theft
but pick a legal system and stick with it
if you rob something that is owned by someone else
its theft
its not up to the thief to decide what is and is not thievable
its up to the owner
again, as the thief and not the owner, no one cares what you think :)
it doesnt really matter
if there was a song owned by sony, and they never intended on ever selling it
i.e. you aren't even robbing them of potential profit,
it would STILL be their discretion about what you can do with it
its not a matter of fairness
its a matter of ownership
depends what the licensing agreement is that you agreed to on purchase
i thought most CDs have a fine print that tell you that you arent authorized to duplicate
it says on this cd: "Unauthorized duplication is a violation of applicable laws."
you could violate that and then ask the courts to re-interpret the applicable laws
a CD is an authorized duplication of someone's intellectual property
dunno... caselaw will determine that, i guess
the owner!
hahah, well congress can pass laws and courts can interpret them
but the foundation of what we're talking about is that private property is sacrosanct
corporations are individuals
and you cant violate the rights of individuals
what i personally believe in is different than the argument i'm making
personally i believe corporations should be illegal and property should be destroyed
not pink, RED
we would destroy about all the corporations which keep our economy going if we did that
well, for instance
if all of a sudden the bay area lost lockheed, bechtel, chevron, there would be a serious financial hurt going on here
and then they would move to somewhere more friendly to them
and the bad stuff would keep happening and we'd be as poor as vietnam
why?
the only thing that allows us to live like that is the capital expropriation that multinationals give us
if those multinationals were suddenly expropriating our resources and labor to some other country ...
nah, the entire argument for nafta and ftaa is that the US is becoming too strict with corporate accountability
so for instance,
NAFTA enables steel companies to leave the midwest
and now a lot of the midwest is like a third world nation
hell, there are places in west virginia that are considered third world by the UN
Encapsulate: in what way?
billf: detroit in the 50s vs. detroit now is such an enormous difference
Encapsulate: third world nations also have busses and electricity and plumbing
billf: well, you can read about it or something then
Encapsulate: the ones i've been to, they do
usually the black market kicks in where the official market fails you
what characterizes third world is not really ownership of things like a tv
it has to do with, how much warfare goes on in your street?
how much time do you spend working without seeing personal gain from it?
it really isnt
i've felt safer in warzones in some countries than i feel walking down a street in cleveland at night
in some countries, you deal with an invading army
in cleveland, you deal with a cracked out fuckup shooting you for $3
hello
rob: you ever use phpgroupware for a project?
rob: i've tried so many free groupware things
they never work out
the only thing that remotely works is a wiki
and i hate wikis :/
yankees?
be quiet and emulate us, sisko
also, get your shit together in indonesia
this bali shit makes us look bad for associating with you all
hey, if you're gonna do colonialism
do it fkn right
you're no fun sisko
you're no fun either
A group of Italian anti-war militants is raising funds to support the armed Iraqi resistance, the BBC has learned.
They say they have collected 12,000 euros ($14,165) in the past eight weeks and admit the money used could be used to buy weapons.
kin: "we"?
toast: or 20-30 roadside bombs
either way, its more than YOU'VE done for the iraqi resistance
so there
kin: so many reasons
is it still treason if you're italian?
it depends where the money goes
there are parts of the iraqi resistance which is not terrorist
not really, i mean most governments in europe dont consider orgs to be terrorist in the same way we do
like PFLP is legit in most of those countries but not here
kin: thats what charity front groups are for
i doubt it, there are plenty of europeans who send tens of thousands of dollars to groups the US considers terrorist
and it really doesnt do anything about it
what can it do? the rest of the world doesnt buy into the US's idiotic terrorism rhetoric
heh, resistance troops still keep coming in from syria
no one really knows
"Its not our affair how they use this money. If they want to use it to print papers for example, or to buy weapons in order to fight for the Iraqi independence," he said. 
"We support the armed struggle in Iraq. our money is to help them, it doesn't matter to us if they use it buy weapons, Kalashnikovs, or medicines for people." 
i have no idea what you're talking about
i thought this was about money for iraq
"Its not our affair how they use this money. If they want to use it to print papers for example, or to buy weapons in order to fight for the Iraqi independence," he said. 
"We support the armed struggle in Iraq. our money is to help them, it doesn't matter to us if they use it buy weapons, Kalashnikovs, or medicines for people." 
oops soprry

LIKE KUWAIT
In The Name Of God, The Merciful, The Mercy-Giving
Operation Sudden Lightning In The Land Of The Tyrant Of The Age
 In compliance with orders of the Commander of the Mujahids, Usamah bin Ladin (may God preserve him), to strike America's economic links, the Abu Hafs al-Misri Brigades struck at two important electricity generating targets in the region of the American East, including the most important economic cities of America and of Canada, (its ally in the war against Islam), the cities of Toronto and New York, and the regions around them.
 We say to the people of Afghanistan and Kashmir that the gift of the Shaykh of the Mujahids, Usamah bin Ladin, is on its way to the White House. Then there will be the gift in honor of al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem. And how will you come to know the nature of the gift for al-Aqsa; when and where will it come?
This is to let the criminal Bush and his gang know that the penalty will be suited to their action. The soldiers of God cut off power to the above named cities, plunging the lives of Americans into darkness, just as the criminals had plunged the lives of the Muslim peoples of Iraq, Afghanistan, and Palestine into darkness. The Americans lived one black day that they will never forget. 
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
NOT TED STEVENS
The above named cities endured a state of chaos and tumult. There was looting and theft. Cities were robbed just as Baghdad, the capital of the Caliphs, was robbed; and just as chaos was spread in Afghanistan and Palestine, in order that the American people would have a taste from the same cup.
It showed that America will not live in security until the conditions that were mentioned in the first and second communiqus have been met. Among them are the release of all prisoners, including Shaykh Umar Abd ar-Rahman, and the departure of [enemy forces] from the land of the Muslims, including Jerusalem, the Arabian Peninsula, and Kashmir.
i thought they were relevant because they are beating US troops in the middle east
of course, if i was the USA i would downplay every terrorist attack that happened and try to make it look like an accident
hlprmnky: ? its like freddy vs. jason logic ... "freddy must be using jason to get us because we forgot about him so his power is lost and he must rebuild it through jason-induced attacks"
the answer is we dont know
we can only hope it was a mighty strike against the u.s.
but like, i've seen a lot of corporate media say that there has been no terror attack on u.s. soil since 9/11
but they are forgetting the martyr of july 4th!
but i dont think they are really forgetting him, just trying to bury it away
THE JULY 4TH MARTYR
well if you recall, the july 4th, everyone made a big deal out of how maybe the terrorists will strike on july 4th
and there was a high terrorist alert level and the media kept speculating about it
and then on july 4th a guy shot up el al at lax
which is a traditional mujahideen terrorist attack
and the media was instantly saying "it might not be a terrorist attack" etc
but for christs sake, it is a STAPLE terrorist attack 
and then months later it came out that it actually was a terrorist attack
i would be willing to bet that el al has EVER been shot up by a random psycho
NEVER even
their security is tighter than any other airline in the world
some random psycho doesnt shoot them
either way, it doesnt matter, it came out later that the guy is mujahideen
for el al you do
and its traditional attack to hit el al's ticket booth, etc all over the world
i think they might, they definitely do now
well the point is dont forget the martyr of july 4th
even though THEY want you to
nah, the point is that under a high security day, at the highest security section of LAX international airport, on JULY FOURTH, a guy strolled in and committing one of the most obvious attacks ever
message: we will attack you at a time and place of our choosing
that guy's brother?
that guy's sun? etc
son even
i dont think you could shoot up el al at lax
its hard
GIVE THE JULY 4TH MARTYR HIS DUE CREDIT!
 Hesham Mohamed Hadayet, 41, opened fire at Los Angeles International Airport's El Al ticket counter and killed two people before being shot dead by an airline security guard.

army bases in seoul :(
speaking of which, in case you missed the news today:
We must keenly watch the aggressive moves of the U.S. imperialists and be fully prepared to crush them at one blow when they pounce upon us.
    No force on earth can block the way of the Korean army and people accelerating the revolution and construction in the spirit of destroying the enemy.
Sherrod: absolutely, US off the peninsula!
because they are preventing reunification
raping local women
driving over them in their trucks
basically fucking things up in the most ignorant way possible, per usual
you must be kidding, right?
the us is the epitome of imperialism
OVERTHROW YOUR GOVERNMENT HERE
PUT YOU IN A CONCENTRATION CAMP HERE
INVADE HERE, VIOLATE INTERNATIONAL LAW THERE
LAST I CHECKED ITS NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS, TWID
the only thing you should be concerned with is getting the rape-ready idiots back here
RAPE-READY
i bet in korea they sit around and wonder, "i bet those americans sit around and laugh about their troops being here"
Countless cases of rape were committed by US soldiers, including a woman gang raped by 4 soldiers' in March 1946, a 14-year-old schoolgirl raped in 1956, a daughter and a mother both raped in 1967, a woman raped by 8 soldiers in the mountains in 1971, a month pregnant teacher raped in 1986 by 5 soldiers in the middle of Team Spirit military exercise, a handicapped schoolgirl sexually harassed in 1996, and a 6-year-old girl sexually haras
YOU ALL DESERVE THE FIERY FATE THAT AWAITS YOU
Sherrod: of course i am
Sherrod: but in case you havent noticed, the most egregious examples of military occupation today largely fall on the US's shoulders
twid: not my fault you dont know whats going on in the world
twid: you are aware of the enormous anti-US protests in south korea? i dont need to go there to realize that isnt based on one uncited paste
tamara: amazing, you are actually increasing the hatred the local population feels for you with each move
anyway, i encourage you all to spend more time in high-rise buildings and on airplanes
it isnt social services republicans are opposed to
not any more or less than the democrats, who followed bill clinton into gutting the entire welfare system
they just dont like the social services that are cronied to their political enemies
socialist?

oh yeah, i work in sf financial district so its not so bad
nothing is free :(
did you know there is state-subsidized beer in cuba?
like about 10 cents a can
but the reason i bring this up?
abortions are free in cuba
so i will rephrase your statement: if communists are in power, abortions are free, safe and legal
60% of pregnancies in cuba are terminated by abortion, the highest in the western hemisphere
my experience is older people in general have severely compounded neuroses that dont mix well with the mental state of people in their 20s
you think they've worked it all out as they get older?
maybe just the older women i've gone out with have been psychotic
i think thats it
clinton killed more iraqis than bush did
sanctions ...
a safe assumption
they were doing fine when iraq was one of the richest arab countries in the early 90s
grab for kuwait? 
it was retaliation for kuwait stealing oil from iraq
who cares? its just formalities that only matter in international courts that arent recognized by the US anyway
hlprmnky: i dont know what saddam intended and i dont really care
i think all the oil cartel barons are enemies and should be dealt with like that
especially the ones operating out of houston
no, everywhere else in the world people understand there is more to the first gulf war than "saddam is evil"
sure but if you've never heard a defense of the first gulf war you must not read the BBC
i would say 95% of americans dont recognize that saddam even had a reason besides irrational power hungry conquest
and there is always that thing where possibly a U.S. envoy gave "permission" for iraq to invade kuwait a week before they did
or at least told iraq that the u.s. would not interfere with inter-arab conflict
1989 Iraq issues formal protest to the UN and OPEC regarding Kuwait's slant-drilling practices that "thieve" oil from Iraqi oil fields.
but saddam doesnt even have a hatred of the US, or an irrational one
baath party succeeded because of U.S. intervention to prevent communists from gaining power
so the history goes back to there, through the iran-iraq war, etc
i would say it isnt even proven that saddam is not still operating with the houston oil faction against the sauds
he was like, "give me a billion dollars, a face lift, and a bunch of martinis, and you can take baghdad"
The question arises as to whether the United States purposively led Iraq to believe that there was no major U.S. objection to invading Kuwait or whether the Bush administration was simply incompetent.
WELL DONT WORRY, the red-green alliance will bring an end to the US's reign of terror
hahahah
the new temporary alliance between muslim groups/governments and communist groups/governments

An American soldier was killed today when bomb blew up a under a military convoy in the violent Sunni Triangle city of Fallujah.
all commies
well, most college kids are supposed to be the target of class war, not part of it
thats the problem
sounds like the best day for it
if only they had a tv to loop the footage of palestinians dancing in celebration of the WTC attacks 
for a palestine demo, if you are going to kill yourself on a bus, you should probably blow it up while you're at it
kin: well i'm from ohio, isnt that close enough?
hahah guess you've never been there
of course most hardcore rednecks hate the u.s. government and israel, for that matter
just the "tim allen tool time" type rednecks who would dislike this stuff
but they dont really count
i lived all over: cleveland, akron, columbus, dayton, cincinnati and a bunch of smaller cities you never heard of
like wapakoneta and eaton
not really, but its a suburb of cleveland
i lived in loraine county though
t12: where from?
lots of those in ohio
and they kept the aliens at wright-patterson afb in dayton
excellent!
hahaha
re: eaton, its close to dayton
the joke is: "are you dayton a girl from eaton or eaton a girl from dayton"
quiet, hep
i wouldnt be up this early on my own accord
FINDING A CHANNEL THAT APPRECIATES ME
i made you download it ... i didnt make you listen to it over and over again
every fkn person who is alive likes rod stewart
well the vast majority of them do
one time i won a contest to have dinner with rod stewart actually
but he didnt show up :(
we just had the exact same frustration in another channel
i dont know eric but he could never be a complainer on par with this guy
t12: what happened?
charges dropped, eh?
?
right! oh how i want a copy of that
they read from it to the juvenile defendants
they said, "the banners were reinforced to be used as weapons"
which is true!
also true!
and they said that there were lead pipes with tiny little flags on them
the fucking idiots who led that group off market and down to mission
they are being so severely disciplined
it breaks my heart to think of it
it was just like 4-5 people at front who led people that way
haha, they dont really need to do much of anything
there are people who are killed by sfpd and their sobbing families get jacked around worse than that
a *communist* group, btw
the communists give you free legal support
the anarchists give you moldy bread when you stumble out of the jail
as do i
we're in the process of getting it through OCC
we = sfimc
office of citizen complaints
its the independent office that works with the police commission
and internal affairs
well, definitely discovery but i wasnt arrested so i have no motions to give
but i mean, if you hang out over at OCC you can really see
they are all attorneys paid by the city and they have clear legal mandates
and even they cannot get the stuff they need from sfpd
and they complain and complain about it, but there's nothing they can do
although, tomorrow morning they are introducing proposed changes to the board of supervisors
and if they approve it, it'll go on the ballot
but the mayor appoints the police commission and they are all corrupt pieces of shit
ultimately, you just realize that its an armed group that isnt accountable to anyone really
and then you realize that SF has the most advanced civilian review of police in the country and you're really sad
350 million *communist* smokers
you guys heard it here first :)

not much

well first i would need $500 to spend on something that frivolous
so whatever
yawn
yes?
i was asleep but then i woke up

hahah dont let the guilt eat you away
the bidun would like you even if they werent faced with extrajudicial disappearances and starvation

hlprmnky: i think one of the big arguments is that fbsd has a tighter security model with regular audits, whereas linux kernel development is haphazard and constantly changing
hlprmnky: thus every 3 days you are recompiling your linux kernel
but it isnt as tight as fbsd's process
hlprmnky: well, those are slight exaggerations but you know what i mean
hlprmnky: thus, security vs. latest hardware support :)
Sherrod: wow, you are arguing against an occupation of your home by outsiders
except they arent outsiders and its only for a week and they dont kill anyone
i say that place isnt occupied enough ... when the burning man people go home, i think the army should move 40,000 soldiers in to live there the rest of the year
"if you thought seoul was fun, wait til you visit sunny occupied nevada!"
the real point: the US military has destroyed nevada's environment far worse than any cultural event ever could
lets get them the hell out!
nekowaifer: thats bullshit. those hippies are ruining the environment we use for nuclear testing
Sherrod: and thats where it stays! just like chernobyl stayed right in that one city
when reno residents start blowing up burning man people, thats when you'll know they are serious
it was in shmuel hanavi
palestinians dont have settlements :(
they have camps 
hlprmnky: a right wing orthodox part of jerusalem
blindly?
i would never say that
no one really ever SAYS that
they just think it :)
but no, they should try to avoid children
but here's the problem, just like the children who died in the attacks in riyadh recently
people should not take their kids into warzones
ok, well if you take your kid into a contested settlement
it is your fault as a parent for taking them there
the combatants are not going to stop just because you are using children as human shields
i would say a right-wing militant neighborhood in jerusalem is not the safest place to raise a child
Sherrod: they are *settlements* it isnt like they've been there for generations
they are intentionally moving there to displace the people who were there before
cj_: there is no "side" and there are 50-60 factions you could identify in the conflict
but this latest attack is strategic for people who want to end the road map process
i would say they are 100% successful in putting the final nail in the coffin of that
now its back to how it was a year ago when the palestinians were winning more victories
let them
israel will have a hard time winning an all-out military war
thats the point of drawing israel into more of a conflict
the road map and oslo accords and etc are the death of the palestinian resistance
Sherrod: you cant even take 200 hippies partying near your house
tamara: that goes against every strategy ever applied for winning a guerrilla war
the palestinians are the best guerrilla fighters on the earth today
hlprmnky: there is no "current peace" and there hasnt been for 50 years
tamara: exactly - just like vietnam, algeria, and a million other examples
hlprmnky: the peace process is an act of war committed by the us/israel, thats the key part
anyway, siding against israel is good for so many reasons if you are already against the united states
"fighting over a toy" is just condescending
you are talking about people's homes, families, culture, etc
i mean, i know it isnt a light-hearted subject like being raped by a military occupier but hey
Sherrod: the funniest part is the recent scandal in south korea where the u.s. military ran over little girls with a truck and caused riots for months :)
cj_: babies born in refugee camps are stateless and can't leave palestine except under special circumstances
you cant blame people who are born in oakland/palestine and dont have the money/power to leave
but i would sure blame a group of people who decided to occupy oakland and get all the blacks out
its more about whose land was it in the last generation
or the last two generations
see: mission yuppie eradication project
its already happened, several development buildings in the mission were set on fire
and the mission eradication project is designed to smash up expensive cars parked around the mission
tamara: in kuwait the dissidents are murdered or disappeared so its prolly more enjoyable?
tamara: no, i think you are defensive about the privileges coming from a situation that validates the kuwaiti government on a daily basis
so many ways
i just mean the u.s./canada is a strong ally of kuwait
i dont know, you seemed upset to suggest that the indian slaveworkers had it so bad, etc
kuwait is one of the worst and most brutal dictatorships in the world
tamara: i really dont think you could ever argue otherwise
its a nation built on importing slave labor for a small rich class
its not even a nation, really
anyway, kuwait's extreme human rights violations are pretty well documented everywhere
(if that whole slavery of a foreign ethncity thing didnt tip you off)
i didnt say anything about you really
except you were defensive about it :)
kuwait is one of the worst and most brutal dictatorships in the world
tamara: but really, if you feel up with it i can argue that kuwait is pure evil and should be dismantled and officials from the US and/or Canada who openly support it have blood all over their hands and really amount to terrorists themselves
but first we can establish that slavery is bad, huh?
tamara, you have bigger things to worry about today anyways
terror alert for kuwait issued 14 hours ago
20 killed in jerusalem, 20 killed in baghdad
not bad
including a high-ranking UN official
also 3 killed in philippines by the communist guerrillas
sorry, 11
lots of us/capitalist class/etc losses today
bombs found at charles schwab's house
busy day, huh?
definitely
no, they were put there to blow him up
or something like that
California police yesterday exploded two devices suspected of being bombs, one found at the front door of offices of the world's largest discount brokerage
Charles Schwab and a second at the home of the company's founder.
hahah
ok
hm, what else gets exploded by police ..?
haha
A bomb squad using a robot and portable x-ray machine to inspect the devices said they appeared to be dangerous. "The x-ray revealed the contents of the briefcases contained items consistent with a bomb," sheriff Mike Kanalakis said.
Hundreds take to streets of Palestinian camp in Lebanon, hand out sweets to celebrate Jerusalem attack
i think the celebration is that the 'peace process' wont kill the intifada
i agree :)
the palestinians dont have to annihilate to win
but israel does
right, the victory scenario is one-state, palestine, with right of return for israeli's
thats when you get peace
a VERY small minority of palestinian factions would have one-state without right of return
but no one sees that as a possibility
anyway, i'm still at work, gotta go

hi
haha, actually i never thought of that
idlenet servers should have an ssl port for irc
i see
i just like it so i can obscure my hostname
for secure communication i use silc
why?
never coredumps for me, ever
we've run it continuously for over a year
well i just dont want some nutcase (who happens to visit idlenet in particular) to be able to grab my hostname from a whois
anything else on idlenet i dont care about
for indymedia irc, i dont really care but things which are quasi-legal we take to silc
SE pbi support? i dont know what that means
??? nonetheless, there is something to be said for not making it easy
because my firewall is terribly insecure at the moment, for one
and because random stalkers on idlenet want to fuck with me
or at least, they have in the past
sooo yeah
long story i guess
FIX IT

so, here's the breakdown:
1) IAC may consider tonight to be the "night of" demo. None of
2) After 7pm, if IAC/DASW havent declared this the "night of,"
3) Breakaway march will not consider today to be "night of" no
4) All are waiting for an official announcement as the
OLD NEWS
and /ignore can protect you from worldviews that dont sit right
i agree
there are indymedia-related individuals who do that a lot
whispered media has a nice studio
they might think you are a cop but you could call wm
i'm sorry
i couldnt resist

oh no
I NEED FIXING
but hep is sucking down mcdonalds food :(
why must her mcdonalds come before my security? :(
unless one of you other kind folks want to fix my hostname?
really how come idlenet doesnt have an ssl port?
aw thanks toast
come on
you think slaughtering innocent people is free?
we've got a reputation to uphold

eggscellent

teargas and difhting
weve accomplished so much and its only 10am!!!
Thousands of Palestinians gather at home of Abu Shanab, denounce Abbas and road map, call for death to Israel
PFLP, Hamas, Islamic Jihad, al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade all quit cease fire
Hamas official calls on Abbas to leave PA territory if he wants end to intifada
the list of israeli violations of the ceasefire is what led to the suicide bombing
hahahah
dear palestinians: i'll do very little to help you, and if you try to win your survival, i'll abandon you altogether
its the victimhood condescension
when they stop being victims all the time, you dont support them anymore
Sherrod: so many exciting things have happened in the last 48 hours
the forces of evil are on the run
mirth: one guy != palestinians, although IDF is the official group representing israelis
Sherrod: it helps me because it pisses me off so much and i can get more stuff done with it on a daily basis
mirth: hahah, i doubt anything would do that
its not for you, its for me!
Sherrod: yeah of course, for years and years but the opinions arent worth much besides making me remember that people dont give a fuck or do anything besides shop if they dont have a brick upside the head
do you think they do?
oh, i mean in the USA
because it all happens for americans benefit, and only because of US support
like everytime you get gas, you think, "i'm so glad i can get this as cheap as i do, those stupid fkn palestinians should just shut up"
Sherrod: israel is a 51st state
like, the reason americans live so much better than the rest of the world...
that comes at a cost
... to them
its true, they do, the EU bloc competes with the US but the US is the most brutal about it
the MOST brutal
believe me, i hate those govts just as much
Sherrod: good idea
communism is the creative solution
*shrug* its a solution
anyways
communists hate liberals more than anyone
deimos: the argument to be made is that a u.s. soldier is like a scab worker
you understand why they are there, they need the money, they have few choices
but at the end of the day, they are actively fighting against you
.af is just as fucked up as .iq
install a drug-running gang as a puppet government?
i think its easier because .af is more redneck and third-worldish
because he supports terror
because we have the strongest legal case against iraq
both republicans and democrats have agreed to fight saddam for the last decade
whereas those other countries, its not so clearcut
either way, a u.s. loss in iraq could really change things forever
it could end the short-lived era of one world superpower
which is why i think you already see moderate political factions starting to outright support iraqi resistance
and an immediate departure of the u.s. from iraq
nah, thats the democrats' line
iraqis are quite capable of running things on their own
i agree, the u.s. should give billions to rebuild iraq
but they should not be there for when it happens
the billions should not go to halliburton or etc
the iraqis are sitting on hundreds of billions of barrels of oil
they can affford to do it on their own
? start up capital for what?
they have an entire oil infrastructure
pipelines, etc
it was all running fine until the UN put restrictions on oil exports
iraqi national oil company
oil has been nationalized in iraq for decades
not saddam, the popular baath party
ok but arab nationalism was not imposed on arabs
my point is just that if we allow "we bombed you" to be an excuse or a justification for occupation,
we aren't any better/worse than rumsfeld and friends
the only answer is a wrong war, a wrong occupation, etc is to stop
er, the only answer to a wrong war/occupation is to end it
possibly, but most iraqis hate the UN for the sanctions regime
i'm with the emerging resistance supporters on the left
tariq ali makes an articulate case for immediate u.s. withdrawal
as to the people who keep blowing up the US soldiers and iraqi police
s/as to/as do/
a possible answer without US involvement, yeah
US will never allow a kurdistan though
cj_: that dmca thing with google begs the question, can you receive a take-down order for material you are just linking to?
cj_: that was the crux of the eff's defense of indymedia 
cj_: they say no but they are trying to find a way to test it in court
cj_: until it is tested, most places will just comply with the take down request
cj_: no one knows ... it hasn't been tested yet :)
but the take down requests from sharman networks are more insidious
if you search for 'kazaa lite' like deimos said
that is dmca trying to crush out spyware alternatives
its kind of funny because for 2 months i was on the board of directors of a bart station flea market, and we were going to be sued by the riaa
because you used to be able to buy pirated DVDs there
but then once those people got kicked out, they had redirection people there, telling you to go down two blocks to buy them
kind of the same thing
i dont think so, if it were stolen cars instead of pirated DVDs, the redirection people would be guilty
well i know someone who went to prison for being a look out for people selling drugs
he didnt sell any drugs or participate in that other than telling people what he saw, who may or may not have been selling drugs
but this is why EFF is waiting for the right case
i think their expert opinion is that based on which case goes to the courts to test dmca on this point will determine the outcome
so, diebold/fraud/etc makes a compelling case

hi
browns won today
they arent an expansion team
Encapsul1te: yeah, i'm intimately familiar with the details
Encapsulate: i'm from northeast ohio and so i've followed the browns my whole life
kuwait is mostly like a country club with old school muslim values taken on so the emirates can shut their women up
but a lot of arab culture sees our outlook on women as non-progressive
like, if you bring up things like sexual freedom you will have to answer for the rape and domestic violence prevalent in western culture
not like here, no
and for instance, there arent homeless people and crack addicts going crazy and stabbing people in parts of large cities, etc
not saying one way or another, but this is an arab perspective i've encountered a lot
the arab perception of the US is that we are all drunk pill-popping idiots who dont take anything seriously except finding better ways to date rape someone
i'm just saying the arab perspective, whether or not you could prove one way or another.. who knows
but certainly things like robbery, homelessness, drug addictions, etc, people in your community are aware of it and its actively discouraged on a social level
whereas here you have 50,000 commercials a day commanding you to be a drunk
so, that has a noticeable effect, etc
they do drink, of course
but not on the same level of americans
anyway, just saying another perspective i've encountered in the world
well, i'm not talking about saudi arabia or kuwait or places like that
like i said before, those are essentially country clubs for the world's richest people
and the discrimination against women is world-famous (except in the u.s. media)
ANYWAY, never mind
penises :D
the perception is more than just about rape, though.. there is no fear of being mugged, or being homeless/hungry, or getting stabbed by a crackhead, etc, normal western decadence, etc.. and these are things you can just see with your experience
so based on this a lot of arabs see our culture as.. mm, decadent or whatever

Four American soldiers were killed and three wounded when an American military vehicle struck a landmine near Barmal in the Paktia province.
Gov.-elect Arnold Schwarzenegger used his first official visit to the state Capitol today to name a health care executive and former aide to Republican former Gov. Pete Wilson as his new chief of staff.
Patricia Clarey, 50, served as deputy to Wilson chief of staff Bob White in the mid-1990s after stints in Washington under Presidents Reagan and George H.W. Bush. 
hi
An American soldier shot and killed a rare Bengal tiger in Baghdad zoo during an apparently drunken party, the head of the zoo said on Saturday.
tigers aside, there's worse stuff in iraq
In Baghdad, up to 70 corpses - of Iraqis killed by gunfire - are brought to the mortuaries each day. In Najaf, for example, the cemetery authorities record the arrival of the bodies of up to 20 victims of violence a day.
well, najaf is a different city than iraq
er baghdad
re: 70 - 20
anyway that was robert fisk on democracy now
http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=03/09/18/1757243
probably
why not?
yeah, i agree
we should also arrest &totse
and every text file kid that ever lived
personally, i agree, and he was hosting it and it looked like it was on his website
so he's stupid, but he doesnt deserve a year in prison 
and the entire way he was snatched up in a raid, flown all over the country, etc
and at the time, there was a crackdown on other left servers in california, like burn at ucsd
it had us concerned, to say the least
the fact is, in the past you could at least voice support or supply information about people who were the enemies of the us government
now you cannot
aside from eastern newsstand at embarcadero one, does anyone know where to get intl newspapers in downtown sf?

that redneck comment had better been bait too
nothing wrong with that
if you are from appalachian west virginia, you are a protected class under cincinnati law
employers cant discriminate against you, etc
thats really the icing on the cake
when people talk about homelessness
like activists or something
generally they arent talking about panhandler weirdos
who may choose to do whatever
most homeless people you never see
because they are hiding from aforementioned weirdos, cops, fratboys who want to fuck with someone irrelevant, etc
most of them are young women but you almost never see young homeless women
exploiting people's feelings about homelessness is a key goal for people like me
thats how i know, being around stuff like that for years and years
if you search for "invisible homeless" .. thats how people describe this phenomenon
most homeless people are women/children, sorry
there really isnt a solution anyways
SF has a reputation for being generous with social services and warm
and its neither
i swear that reputation is the only reason why so many homeless people migrate here
right, that kills you
people used to get killed just when their heat got turned off in ohio
so some liberal bleeding heart made them have a "lifeline" program
during the winter
again, if you're able to defend yourself or intimidate people, its not SO bad
thank god for the wisconsin apartment association:
q: Can I evict tenants from my apartments during the winter? Are there any statutes or rules preventing a landlord from utilizing eviction procedures?
aml: At this time of year, this question is asked by landlords who have been told that they cannot evict residents that have breached their lease after a certain date in the fall or winter. However, nothing exists in state law which alters a landlord's right to evict a tenant for a breach of the lease terms because of the time of the year or weather.
This idea must stem from the prohibition against the gas or electric company from suspending service during the winter to low income persons when their bills are delinquent.
WHEW!
well, thats just wisconsin though
gets cold there, tho
ok one last consideration for you:
Under Communism, homelessness did not exist, because the government provided all housing. In the post-Communism era, homelessness has become a serious problem in big cities like Moscow.
but then the luxury classes have to do work 
and they get all bratty about it
oh yes
a society whose goal is to destroy poverty and 1600 other social evils
BUT THEY ARENT DOING IT GOOD ENOUGH

and at least they banned aljazeera from iraq
whereas they just bombed aljazeera out of afghanistan
well doctors without borders are communists
and aljazeera are muslim fundamentalists
and red cross is drs w/o borders sympathizers
so it seems reasonable
oh i forgot, they did bomb aljazeera in baghdad.. that one guy died when they hit the palestine hotel
its like that green beret said:
We took the clown in custody and were asked rather indignantly by the twit from BBC if we were trying to shut up "the poor man who had seen his mosque and friends blown up." I told the airy-fairy who the raghead was and if he knew Arabic (which he obviously didn't) he'd know he was a Palestinian. I suggested we take him down to the local jail and we'd lock him and his cameraman in a cell...
more bombings of journalists, less annoying questions from them
me too, except the embedded journalists
who are pure propaganda tools
not really, i like talking about whats going on in the real world

money?
frienster isnt making much money, are they?
yeah its that one guy
he funds some thing my work does as well
but i think its less the concept, and more him throwing money at his friends
or, rather, friends of his family
thats my impression from him throwing like a million at this one project where i work
maybe, i dont use friendster but my coworkers complain about how slow it is
its like livejournal, do those subscriptions really pay for them to scale with more boxes/etc for usability?
i guess so
hm, the place i work sells email lists
but they burn out pretty quick
friendster got $13 million in investment money
it isnt, its about 1-2 years operating costs for barebones company
thats why, because it doesnt pay that much
for print, it pays a lot
i normally dont use a computer with flash installed
i cant believe the predominance of those annoying flash ads

An explosion on a major gas pipeline near Iraq?s northern oil centre, Kirkuk, has crippled production at the country?s newest and largest oil refinery.
An explosive device has been confirmed as the cause of the blast that created a massive fire visible from 30 kilometres away. 
:D also http://dubai.linefeed.org/pipeline.php
well if they can put off oil profits until after the CPA gives up control
they have the option of nationalizing all the modernizations brouhgt by bechtel and the cpa

the only acceptable thing to happen is the US withdraws, immediately
but yes, the US should donate billions to reconstruction that they dont have any part in aside from financing it, no strings attached
iraq would be regionalized as it was before the artificial british "iraq" was created
kurds would fight for a state, for instance, as they have been
and others would do the same
as opposed to a US-orchestrated bloodbath?
the US is not protecting minorities, are they?
no, what is better is that the US is not rewarded for imperial war
under the US, the turks dont need to roll into kurdistan
they have the US army to do it for them
thats why the PKK has canceled their cease fire now
what you are saying is that nations get a moral obligation to colonize a country they invade
which is about as good as saying that nations get the reward of colonizing a country they invade
the US should get nothing but embarrassing defeat
the whole world understands that the US will withdraw -- maybe -- when they have a US-friendly government installed
that is victory
getting kicked out because the US public finally wont accept a grisly colonial occupation where more US troops are dying than being greeting as liberators
thats defeat
sure, its called guerrilla war
its how the british lost in afghanistan
its how the soviets lost in afghanistan
etc etc etc hundreds of examples
well, what can you do?
only places like the aclu have a practical effect on the matter
because they could theoretically get an injunction
all i know is i've been to big/small protests all over the country, and the protest last week in miami was the biggest police mobilization i've ever seen
with lots of undercovers, lots of people with M16s, lots of APCs
i dont know where they got the money for all that
well, ok, i do
but it was pretty impressive
but really, with these expansion of police powers things
not enough people care
and those who do cant really do anything about it
except be more security conscious in what they are doing
like, for on the ground coordination we had people using handhelds and cellfones
but we used arabic and farsi speakers to do the communication and then relay it back to people face to face
i figure thats a good enough code for on the spot
and even then we were seriously followed and photographed
the CATIC thing is what has most people sketched out locally, after the war protests until today
lots of people getting strange visits from the police
lots of people's houses being raided
lots of people on student visas being taken away for weeks at a time with little outside contact
its unnerving, that CATIC
its because

In a memorandum posted recently in the Fox News computer system, John Moody, a Fox News Channel senior vice president, ordered his staff to avoid Schwarzenegger movie puns.
"The urge may seem irresistible to play off Arnold Schwarzenegger's acting career," Mr. Moody wrote. "Resist it. Otherwise the effect is often to belittle the candidacy of the front-runner for one of the most important offices in the U.S., and that's not fair and balanced."
The controller of BBC1 launched an unprecedented attack on Rupert Murdoch yesterday, calling the media billionaire a "capital imperialist",
"I would suspect that everybody who works for Rupert Murdoch knows what he expects of them and they know that if they don't deliver they will be booted out," said Ms Heggessey. Newspaper readers "know when they are being peddled a line," she added.

i imagine this landmark peace offer will go the same way
and they really do, too, always going on about how "we offered them a state in 2000"
 "Soufiane al Tikriti was the man of the Americans in Baghdad," the newspaper wrote. "He signed onto an agreement guaranteeing that the 10,000 elite soldiers of the Special Republican Guard would not fight."
:((
they just want iran to quit messing up the occupation i think
this is a message to me that we should help iran mess up the occupation
yeah, and they always arm the palestinian terrorists too
they have pirates on boats who bring guns, hep
sample pirate boat, probably from iran:

ones that arent pea green like that one hopefully
this is a bad weekend to go to jail
because monday is a holiday
might have to wait until tuesday
is he at santa rita?
cant you just run a x aim client on your fw and ssh -X to it ?
er fw = box at home
works ok for me and i have the world's worst DSL
and oppose real attempts at enforcing the treaties
but the best one is the u.s. opposing prohibition of child combatants
well the reasoning is that some u.s. soldiers are 17
and so many of the us's allies uses children as combatants
no, international law would define what adulthood is
hm, i think its because the u.s. always opposes united nations-style moderation of combat zones
the u.s. and corporations dont like some snooty bureacrat organization snooping around paramilitary actions that they are paying for
without a doubt within
its really true
money buys you security
your mom is smart
money also buys you freedom
sure, but what can you do?
you need money to do that
well, you should just consider that within the last 10 or 15 generations at least, that money advice holds true
hey, me too
security and freedom are prerequisites to happiness
sure, but security is a big part of that which can be outside of your control
whatever issues you have are fully under your control
now thats ennui
i thought it was french for boredom
when the hell have hackers ever been anything but rwh?
in the united states, i mean
but most attorneys i know from like NLG or ACLU say that most patriot act stuff is just legitimizing and formalizing what already goes on
so like, the FBI can probably already get travel records on you from private corporations
but this just makes it easier for them and they can do it at companies they dont already have contacts in
they were as violent as they could have been
local news said 16 cops injured
the mayor got punched in the face and his car destroyed
fires in the streets, throwing rocks and tear gas at the police
barricades
they tried
just too many police
sure, they had that in quebec and genoa recently
and in san francisco this spring
except the napalm part
yes they did
during the ftaa protests there
thats not a protest, thats an insurrection
the ones just ending in miami
yes
well, the ones for ftaa were in quebec, then quito, now miami which will probably be the permanent hq for ftaa
active?
there was national organizing for a padded bloc
at meetings in chicago, pittsburgh, oakland, denver, florida
otherwise it is just whoever shows up in black bloc garb
people who coordinate bringing body armor and helmets to the protest
so you dont have to run away when they shoot rubber bullets at you
where are you going t12?
how come
not bad
mmm, no
their bidding process is rigorously regulated
i think clinton tried to pass a law that allowed there to be blacklisting of contractors who were antiunion or antienvironment
for federal contracting
i think mostly contracts go to unions because they hold power like that in local and state govts
i just dont think they are required by law to use union contractors
so cronyism might be tighter on the local level than federal or something

my mom would always be pissed when my friends came over and demanded food
food costs money
and my mom would always tell me not to expect food at other peoples houses
the worst was when we ate through the food for the week before the scheduled shopping day
eyes :(
how do grades matter?
eh, most of your placement in college depends on money
i mean, you could be a straight 4.0 student through high school but there's lots of people like that
so, what does that get you, in the end? not much, i dont think
a robust high school career helps to get into college
i.e. extracurriculars, scores, etc
Sherrod: sure they are, its not hard, its mostly just work
never went in the first place, so nyah
i couldnt justify spending the money
making money vs. going into debt
but i think its good for kids to do well in school and then naturally figure out its a scam on their own as they get older, and figure out a good plan for themselves
so they can get out by age 16 and support themselves
not self-righteous, self-sufficient
i know lots of 16-year-olds who are a lot smarter about the real world than people twice their age
i think its like $7 in california
strange, i swore ohio minimum wage was $5.15, but the dol says its $4.25
says it is current as of july 2003
but i know ohio minimum wage was greater than $5 when i lived there
is minimum wage going down? :(

zsh does filename completion through ssh?

but not as cheap
you get what you pay for :)
i know lots of people going there
of course, it isnt with the cpa
its to work against them
i'm going to try when i'm over there this winter
cpa is the military dictatorship
the administrative side
fundamentalists like george bush?
i know someone who got arrested that u-turn way
it wasnt because they had drugs in the car, its because someone in the car had warrants
oh lord, just to set the record straight i am not going to iraq to fight anyone like john walker

except OPD more openly frames people, more openly beat people, and more openly attack crowds
OPD has the riders, SFPD has fajitagate
but dont become a cop
you wont be human anymore :(
sure but, not like these cops
the ambulance workers?
existing police departments are the exact opposite of that
you cant find out anything about anything
so, until that happens, we should fight these unaccountable paramilitaries
not join them
i'm anti-cop because even the non-vigilante cops protect the ones who are
although that rookie kid who turned in the riders, that was amazing
*maybe* he's a good cop, but he's young and naive still
:(((
Deliberations in "The Riders" police corruption criminal case were suspended Wednesday after a juror's note prompted defense attorneys to demand a mistrial.

how can i register a domain with the most anonymity?

yeah, ccn, this is the problem
i mean, i *really* need it to be anonymous

there is no way, is there? :(
haha i did that and then i decided to switch domain names because i feel too bad implicating hep :(

hmm
i wondered if you burned out and went to sleep
you're a trooper
anyway, you should come here, its a party
People had the mayor, the board of supes, the chief of police and three hundred cops holed up in their last stand and surrounded by burning police cars.
Had anybody had the stomach to knock aside the pacifists who linked arms in front of the main door (which was being bashed open with parking meters), the mob would have massacred the whole lot. Everybody was up for a righteous, bloody massacre. Nobody had the stomach to smack aside pacifists, though. Odd thing, that.
what happened to san francisco? :(
yeah me too
no, i lived up and down the cleveland-canton corridor
i never really saw anything beautiful anywhere around there
u.s. soldier killed in iraq today, another one seriously wounded
http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&cid=540&e=2&u=/ap/20030526/ap_on_re_mi_ea/iraq_roundup
other articles say 4 wounded
i just like to keep track
money for college
it is easier, too
i know a lot of people who enlisted
cuz then you dont have to look people in the eyes before you kill them
well we should all enlist in militaries that oppose the u.s. one
its the least we can do
i dont want the u.s. to survive as it is :(
90% of the world doesnt
haha, well it isnt a statistic, i'm just saying
its like the demilitarization of germany or japan
u.s. should lose its military, asap
well, it would have immediate gains for some people
palestinians, colombians, filipinos, venezuelans, argentines, etc
the u.s. situation is that we enforce a new form of colonialism at gunpoint
and i dont care enough about only americans to defend that
its rigged to the extent that either of the people who could have won would have continued things as they are
iraq was a warzone under clinton and bush
bush is just more open about it because they dont have to placate liberals
when has there not been u.s. intervention?
no, i'm saying that democrat, republican, this year, last year, ten years ago the goal of the US has been the same
colonize people for the profit of a few americans
who represent a very small percentage of the world population
92?
i mean, we bombed afghanistan under clinton, bombed afghanistan under bush
oh gulf war
either way, i want to go to the beach now
maybe we'll witness the beach-front north korean amphibious assault
our long awaited liberation will begin!
later all

there are lots of community stations
you've got san francisco liberation radio
thats 93.7
#insub contact?
then there is enemy combatant radio, which is on the air spottily
then there is kpoo which has a commercial license but is indy
oh, well, i'm in tight with all these groups
then there is bay view hunters point pirate radio
then there is free radio berkeley, but i dont know the status of that right now since they got raided
SFLR does
and FRB did, but it was janky and it might have been broken by this strange, bad man
and KPOO at least has a cart system
but i doubt its automated
ah, i see
well i can ask around
i'll ask SFLR, they are the most together of them all
ok well, i left my friend at sflr a message
i hate wikis :(

and plus, do we count brits?
i agree
so this week its almost 10 i think
i want to at least keep track on a website somewhere
the best part was one guy who died in afghanistan was previously quoted in a cnn article
so indymedia wrote a thing about it
because his quote in the cnn article was: "its kind of like a vacation, just way more hot than you want, otherwise its kind of fun"

SOLDIERS shot in the Iraqi police station massacre begged to be spared by showing their killers pictures of their loved ones, it emerged last night. 
Their pleas were in vain - there was no mercy. Three of the six who died were found together slumped against a corner of a 15ft by 8ft room at the police base at Majar al-Kabir in southern Iraq.
Those who died with Sgt Hamilton-Jewell, 41, and Cpl Long were Cpl Russell Aston, 30, who had a 17-month-old daughter, Cpl Simon Miller, 21, L/Cpl Ben Hyde, 23, and L/Cpl Tom Keys, 20.

optional gas-water mix spray is a nice accessory item
problem is that water cannon isnt very effective

6 people are arrested from the pride marches this weekend
charged with felony threatening a public official
its because they burned an effigy of gavin newsom
Supervisor Gavin Newsom was reportedly uninjured when five women and a man, all clad in black and wearing pink bandannas around their necks, allegedly shouted threats as they tried to approach the car he was in, according to Sgt. J.R. Seim.
Seim said the suspects were placed in a police van and could be charged with possession of a deadly weapon because some were carrying signs tied to copper pipes.
newsom ran that care not cash campaign
and he's extremely pro-gentrification, unashamedly

us news: There was a series of massive and well coordinated attacks on U.S. forces in Iraq today. American troops were able to fight back, killing dozens of the attackers.
arab news: But local residents said US troops killed innocent bystanders when they opened fire on anything that moved around midday.
Workers at a nearby pharmaceutical plant said at least two colleagues were killed and many wounded as they walked out of the factory gates at the end of their shift, downed by a US tank shooting randomly in all directions.

the iron cross was a military award for nazi soldiers
and it was used predominantly in WWI
either of those militaries is kind of sketchy to align oneself with, no?
i went with hep to some thing one time and people were wearing iron crosses
i'd never seen that before, it confused the hell out of me
pexor, you should get a big hammer and sickle
something else
unless you got a business card that says, "yes, i am using a symbol which is used by the nazis and otto reich's regime, but it doesnt mean that, it means something else, etc etc"
you should get a tattoo of that picture on pexor.com
that'd be weird, no?

php vs java is at least an argument to be had
php is best used when you use its oop stuff
no room?
its a way to enforce discipline on php programmers
because there arent many other ways
well php oop has worked for me
but python is vastly inferior as a web language
yahoo recently switched all new projects to php
all good php code does templating
its the pear standard
that you can violate that if you need to in a pinch
easier setup and installation and maintenance than java
more functionality needed by web development
i dont have to try and figure out which cpan module is broken this week and why

i mean, there are 8 new web projects happening at my company right now and we're sort of using a standard api we wrote
but if each of those teams had to figure out getting started on perl it would be a nightmare
the biggest downfall of php vs java is that it lends itself to a culture where applications arent well designed
kind of like perl
sure, but you see some php applications with 18-level deep include file setups and life turns to shit
speaking from a php perspective, i think it lends itself to poor design decisions
there are shortcuts that you just cant take in java
certainly, the difference is i think most projects using php are trying to get an advantage through sloppy design
or application design isnt valued as much in php projects
t12: thats the attitude ;)
there is a right / strict way of doing a php application for real
cj_: could you make that argument if you couldnt use strict?
agreed
but you can see how use strict helps with what we're talking about?
it helps for the language to be interpreted differently or more strictly when it gets down to it
it encourages it more than a language that prohibits it altogether!
the other problem is i've never found a web application framework for perl
i mean, they exist but there is so much overhead its like learning a new language
given a choice between kerry and bush i'd go with bush
pfft, on any issue i care about bush and kerry have about the same position
except when a democrat is in office most people dont care about us foreign policy
at least bush makes them pissed off
hlprmnky: i'm pretty sure clinton killed more iraqis than bush did
not just starvation, bombing too
the democrats make conquest and imperialism appealing to the young hip generation
at least they're SUPPOSED TO
but they cant even do that anymore
seen hep?
because they are put up by wealthy activists who want to make the news
so they come up with the most ridiculous things and send them off in it
  thats not it
its because philip k dick cant come up with a good story
i also got new underwear
from target
but you dont see ME asking for a parade in my honor
pfft
i only met hep like 3 times in real life
i just know her on irc
honestly
i met her like 3 times
why is it important to have kerry or someone like him replace bush?
i know there are differences, but they are mostly differences i dont care about and i dont see why you would either
like, a different segment of oil barons and etc get power for 4 years, etc
in the end, the last democrat gutted welfare worse than bush did, hurt the working class with nafta way more than bush did
also attacked iraq and afghanistan and sudan etc

how much was it?
ufff
i got one for $200
a 1u, that is
i dunno the specs but trying to move it
that 2u doesnt belong to you, hep!@
i need it eventually
THOSE URUGUAYANS ASK ABOUT IT EVERY GODDAMN DAY
anyways
what kind? i386/etc
ok, and it might be $250
now that i thought about it
and no its not at my place, a friend has it
whats your needs?
yeah, i'm pretty sure its like that, not dual though
wait, let me find out more if i can
she does not have one
and its not for sale
t12: specs are en route
ok here's what i got, t12
today, i can do a 2u with 9 drive bays, hardware raid, p3-700 for $300
in a day or two, i can do a 1u thats prolly the same p3-700 for $250
but i can get confirmed specs in a day or so on the 1u
wtf is t12's email?
if the US was taken over by a foreign country, would you feel inclined to blow up fellow Americans who volunteer to help them?
seriously, i would definitely be a quisling for north korea
but really, there are few countries around who i would accept as a new legimitate authority after years of bombing my country
i dont think i would think much of collaborators
i thought you were a layabout, joseph
retirement?
why would you get a masters in cs just to go to law school?
i dont get it
i used to work at a law school
being a secretary for 10 lawyers / professors
i was the only guy in the entire secretary department and the youngest by 15 years or so
but i scored the highest ever on their typing speed test so i got in
thats how i started moving up in the world

the source code, that is
it'll be the most insane cease-and-desist campaign you've ever seen
isnt the flagrant violation of federal drug laws more egregious?
i guess there isnt as much grandstanding that goes along with that
t12: the cannabis clubs..
well its interesting because it could potentially push gwb into radical right fringe
and it pushes kerry into the not-so-radical right
gay marriage
if he supports a constitutional ban, he's officially entered nutty right wing
i think most sensible people dont want sex to be talked about in the constitution

nah, the libertarians and gun nuts hate this
but there is partisan stuff on both sides
democrats who supported clinton's ridiculous anti-terrorism crap dont support this, and vice-versa
armed citizens can form armed militias, and those have a good chance of beating even the largest military, over time
but most of the armed militias were destroyed in the mid-90s
seriously, t12.. in latin america when there are disappearances and things like jose padilla, people start shooting
here no one really gives a fuck
its been happening for real in the last decade, since the omnibus law
and there were people who opposed it with guns but they were pretty much infiltrated, jailed and/or killed
the big advantage they have is guerrillas in other countries can easily get RPGs
and they get funding from super rich people
and u.s. militias are mostly poor people
but the black panthers were pretty good
but again, they got funding and arms from china
but really, destroying an entire federal building
thats impressive
tim mcveigh's explanation was pretty good too, it was mostly based in an anti-iraq war justification
he said the people in the federal building were collateral damage to him, just like the iraqis were when he was in the army
most armed struggles i can think of havent really been sparked by starvation
LA has about as many murders per day as israel/palestine
americans are just too protected from the real world
for most people you can hole up with a job, tv, and a computer and not ever really think about anything really going on
whereas other countries, it isnt so easy to do that
thus, the theory goes, commit terrorism against a docile and uncaring civilian population 
and they will care
dprice: its a protracted struggle
if you are a maoist you believe the revolution is against middle- and upper-class americans in general
and sometimes the u.s. working class
hey!
u.s. ghettos have done pretty fkn good against the national guard
sure, but also those people are abandoned by almost everyone except the most radical left
so the answer is push the left further left
upper class :)
i just cant wait until people find out there's no such thing as gay divorce
 
of course the majority of people send the message by not voting

good reason to bitch
er good reason to not vote i mean

t12: dunno
the oil and water wars have already started :(
ralph nader is a guest on NBC Today, Good Morning America ABC, Democracy Now, CNN Inside Politics, PBS Jim Lehrer, MSNBC, and CNN-Paula Zahn today
thats quite a schedule
i still dont really see what would be a difference between bush and kerry, besides some watershed issues about being gay or something
personally i would prefer bush because the upfrontness and pride in what they are doing is more refreshing than snake oil salesmen lulling everyone back into a coma
i.e., there werent millions in the streets when clinton was massacring iraqis, etc
Encapsulate: there comparably-sized protests against clinton's interventions in iraq?
Encapsulate: haha, there werent
cj_: sanctions, bombing, etc
Encapsulate: the protests against bush were the largest world protests in recent history
Encapsulate: i mean, there were protests and lots of people worked on it
Encapsulate: but most americans didnt know or care
Encapsulate: i dunno, i did work on sanctions stuff then like tech support or something, but in ohio there wasnt any momentum for street protests
but then most people in ohio were protesting the democrats' complete sellout of workers under nafta

please, atheists are more fanatical than most catholics i know
the answer is: because its the mystery of faith
there is no answer, t12
its a MYSTERY
the mysteries of faith are a hard concept to grasp, definitely
all i know is, jews go to hell
becaues they killed the son of god
its more than a belief, its a culture, a religion, etc
its complicated
more complicated than "why not believe something else"
its the mystery of faith
its really about culture, how people are socialized with each other, how it makes people feel, what concrete realities it has with people, etc
generally trying to invalidate another person's culture is kind of 18th century
GROSS
you actually used it?!

hamtaro: yeah, but i dont see what that has to do with anything i said
anyways, i encourage you all to study the coup in venezuela
its pretty earth-shattering for OAS politics, especially in terms of the mainstream media from the US
Fahrvergnugen: but on the other hand, you cant put all the blame on me for defensive reactions
well, that was reciprocal to what i was being called
however,
thats not what i said
i said in the context of OAS coups, you have to be an idiot to believe the mainstream media when they say one happened
and i'd love to discuss that
oas is organization of american states
but no one has really wanted to discuss that, instead focusing on whether or not the australian or BBC is read by anyone besides rage against the machine fans
haha ok
i'm not too impressed the other way around
hamtaro: agreed

in other news, which certainly has nothing to do with anything else:
Tens of thousands of supporters of President Hugo Chavez marched on Sunday to protest what they criticised as US meddling and rally support for the leftist leader as he battles an opposition referendum challenge.
Waving revolutionary flags and "Out with the CIA" and "No to Yankee Invasion" banners, Chavez sympathisers streamed through the capital under the watch of National Guard troops and two military helicopters circling overhead. 
anytime anyone wants to actually discuss the content of what i said, i'm around
in the meantime i'm gonna be listening to the clash and reading the wingnut BBC and reuters
whats worse is feeling superior and dont even have the balls to discuss it :P
kz is saying that it was okay to kill civilians in the world trade center, because some of the people in that building were attacking osama and friends
shock rays or laser beams or what have you, we'll be doing our best to bring 1968 to rnc
i remember when their water gun machines were supposed to disperse crowds
those were easy to circumvent
and it was the dnc in 1968 which got out of hand
and then there was the "heat gun" which got bought but was never used
padded bloc / tutti bianche are mostly trots
isosceles: you cant find the websites because they are in arabic and always up and down
kavkaz.org was one of the better ones but their hosting changed from country to country until they became more moderate
also, the some of the 'websites' are really just someone from the group calling aljazeera and saying "go to this url"
at least, at one point hamas was basically notifying indymedia and reuters of their suicide bomb statements
when their website was offline
thats how it worked for that..
always some different, random url they put stuff at and then its gone but they count on the media to mirror it for them
azzam.org was really the best jihad news source in english
wayback machine doesnt have 2/3s of their stuff, unfortunately
but when the war in afghanistan was on, you could watch the news appear on azzam
then slowly migrate to reuters, then MAYBE make other western press
but they really had the best flash animations ever
the US chased them from country to country to get them offline
its ok, the end result is that they have al jazeera
and a half dozen other satellite television stations
fascism is right-wing because it is nationalist, capitalist and reactionary vis-a-vis communism
some strands of communism developed socialism-in-one-state
that could be considered nationalist, i suppose
and some free market capitalists distinguish fascism as 'corporatism' rather than capitalism
but..
the democrats have spent 30 years alienating their base, republicans havent
even my family is done voting democrat since the democrats helped destroy the steelworkers union
s/helped/led the charge to/
tarriffs are a lot more complicated, but i think the issue is uswa is so shattered that they arent going to mobilize too many voters anymore
true free marketeers, but thats not what the republicans are
my dad wasnt going to vote for the first time in decades
i told him to vote for nader instead
dertx: exactly, which is why kerry for president gets to table outside an anti-war movie
you basically want the democrats, then... they are socially liberal and neoliberal economically
thats an old perception re: democrats. clinton destroyed welfare.
http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2004/06/27/BAG0T7CUHP1.DTL
the difference is republicans are investing money in the us's economy
whereas democrats burn money in govt welfarism
massive defense spending is an investment in everyone
rich liberals dont like thinking about how beneficial the wars are to them
we just had a project stalled because we set it up using rac
and finally, our db consultants said they were jacking their price for supporting rac on linux
+ netfiler, because it doesnt really work
yeah
i worked a place that used as/400 throughout.. the secretaries cried and cried when it was replaced with a win32 gui
anyway, we had oracle consultants out and they said oracle 9i rac works fine with solaris
and that they had 'experience' making it work with linux
but when we got specific, the technical sales guy had 'to check'
i.e. how can we run oracle rac when we have to nfs mount with noac option
your govt spent a lot of money building up the spla
they arent going to just let it all go to waste
however it doesnt go the other way
when hep demands affection or attention or anything,
 <LooseChanj> are there any democrat oil people?
al gore is famous for his ties to occidental petroleum
which begs the question of clinton's support of paramilitaries in colombia
mirth: never too late to broaden your knowledge
luckily, no one really cares when democrats go to war for oil
me neither, stupid colombians. did you see how funny george bush looked today?
kqed has over 100,000 watts, not even sure if kalw has 2,000
nobody in israel makes jokes about how the terror threat probably isn't real
i wonder how long before americans figure it out..
a lot less different now that bush/kerry agree on prolonged occupation in an arab country
... anymore :)
you doubt the will exists to kill and terrorize americans?
or you doubt the capability exists for that?
agreed on both with similar quality intelligence sources
uss cole
and did a pretty fkn good job, i'd say
i'd say the largest attack on us soil in 50 years is worth a decade of planning
i just find a lot of current criticism to be based in naivete and coming from logic tainted by partisanship
like, saddam hussein did have relationships with al qaeda and was a pretty logical choice in prosecuting a war on terror
i think its a result of american lack of attention span
most people were shitting their pants on sept 12th
denial is a characteristic of imperial citizens, to put it another way
its on the news, but most people hardly pay attention to the news anyway
in israel you get the gas masks and innoculations and drills
we differ in proximity but make up for it in an open society with relatively open borders
i'm suggesting that if you buy enough of the lie to have a democrat viewpoint, you should be a republican
because their arguments are better :)
invading iraq is a way to wage a "war on terror" if you accept that, which all mainstream politicians do
they are open about making iraq a physical, less amorphous front in the war on terror
while removing a dictator who is open about supporting islamic terrorists
deimos: or jewish terrorists, i agree
everyone knows saddam had an open policy of paying tens of thousands to suicide bombers families
who mostly came from hamas or islamic jihad
for instance
which is why palestinians march through the streets with his portrait in pro-saddam rallies
sponsored by aforementioned hamas and islamic jihad
well, saddam publicized it, hamas/islamic jihad did, cheney says it all the time, etc
thats good enough for me
plus i've been to one of those pro-saddam rallies sponsored by islamic jihad
prior to the latest u.s. adventure there
but none of this is really debated, both parties agree, its just whose turn is it to spin for action against terrorism
when clinton and all the democrats fought for their own "patriot act,"
you had orrin hatch arguing against it
now bush must do it, and you have democrat shills arguing in reverse, etc
when it comes down to it, they all support the war action and then try to spin it to their advantage
in 1991 or 2003 or whenever
uganda was the next runner-up to palestine for the new state of israel
it didnt conflict with the zionist goal of conquering palestine to a jewish state
it was meant to be a precursor 
and in hindsight that plan gets more credibility as eretz israel slips more and more away
a fact i used to throw around about 9 months ago was that the total number of people (arab/jews) killed in the intifada was about equivalent to homicide deaths just in LA in the same time period
dunno if thats still true
avoiding certain neighborhoods also works in israel
hlprmnky: almost all of them are in disputed parts of jerusalem or in-between cities and right-wing settlements
for instance, going to a fundamentalist jewish settlement in the west bank increases your chances of getting shot
no, those are the places that moderate israeli's want destroyed (as does most of the world outside of US/Israel)
that happens in a democracy
like, should we start killing mexicans now so "we" arent outnumbered in 10 years?
that's already the de facto situation, palestinian population projections show a clear majority in 10 years
hlprmnky: yes, mexicans did use to live here, see: annexation and mexicans are in a similar apartheid-type situation 
us/mexico border is just as if not more militarized than the israel/palestinian border
kingmob: but that area is ready for the world's greatest tourist economy in history
it is _now_ because the 50-year-old war kind of drags on tourism
it would get bethlehem
hlprmnky: as in, california has a large number of people living and working here who dont get to vote or even if they did, much political power beyond that
i guess, but legal or not its the reality and isnt going away.. if anything, there's a trend to legalize parts of it (i.e. drivers licenses for noncitizens)
anyway, a jewish fundamentalist state next to an islamic fundamentalist state, i dont see much difference
the election terror in spain drove people to vote hard left
i think the same would happen here, if we had a left-wing alternative
people suddenly lose their will to fight when they are scared
so they are more inclined to vote anti-war, anti-occupation i think
jttf's in sf and portland and la are all creeping around rnc organizing
and dnc organizing this year, even on the news tv in the elevator at my work it was talking about FBI warns domestic terror group will attack corporate media at DNC
which has been talked about on semi-open mailing lists, to be fair
most of the young protesters would love another 1968, in boston and new york this year
the best part i just found out is one of the 4 main organizing groups for rnc just compromised on their protest
so it will be a protest way on the other side of the city, on a freeway that is shut down to prevent terrorism
and police buses will bus protesters to this deserted stretch of freeway to protest
i dunno about that
there are people who think the protests are useless unless a riot happens
not at all
you remember why the rodney king riots happened?
now, do you remember the protests against clinton's wars in iraq and bosnia?
its not really aimed at convincing anyone 
its intended to be a show of force
san francisco is more right-wing than the protester base
more right-wing than the protester base
who are mostly communist or something like that
a good many don't
the march 20th war with vigilante executives in the financial district shows that, at least :)
there was a lot of fighting with the police during iraq war protests here, its called democracy
dissidents fight with police in every country in the world, the US is the most restrictive in that sense of all western democracies
the point was to use force to make a general strike happen in downtown SF
and in that sense, the more stock brokers you have coming down to duke it out with protesters, the more successful the protest is
for instance, you may live in SF and have leftist sympathies, but if i'm glad to see people prevented from going to work at Bechtel, for instance
most people are glad to have an excuse to not go to work for a day or two
most people i know arent 'afforded' that right
they work an 8 hour day and then keep working all night on leftist projects
but there are trustfund college rich kids who infest it, and they are almost universally hated
anyway, rnc could be a flop, nyc protests are never very good
and the intimidation factor is hurting this time around
send money, supplies and bodies
welcome to the dnc!

sure, but you dont get pictures of the people being carried away
sometimes you do, but its rare
you guys already forget the questionably lawful detentions over the past 3 years?
remember, the aclu had to sue to even find out who it was and they still didnt get to know
but the raids against convention protest planners took place in the last week, none *at* the convention yet
but based on what happened at the last election's conventions, there is a good chance
anyway, there is a federal investigation on-going into people planning protests at the conventions
grand jury subpeonas went out today
which followed all last week of FBI raids and detaining people in colorado, kansas, missouri and ohio
hamtaro: any news site? news.google.com?
hamtaro: so, you would care if someone more proficient in photoshop delivered those pictures to you..?
twid: but fundamentally, there have been problems with law enforcement and this convention, and at least the last two conventions
twid: so, informed opinion would lean towards being disturbed at a large-scale riot police mobilization at a convention
twid: good argument.
hamtaro: i would prefer a professional response 
any other country has a protest 10 times the size before they bring out that kind of presence
hamtaro: when you get a federal grand jury subpeona, you'll start to understand maybe?
i just posted a picture, i cant help it if your kneejerk reactions are so ill-informed :)
twid: i have no desire to have you on my side, believe me

hey, i'm just used to having political discussions that arent polite
the whole banning awkwardness, i dont think i can be blamed for

convince you i'm not totally paranoid? is that what happened here?
how is anything i said today "shitting on the channel" ?
or for that matter, in the previous banning incident?
i see, the answer is tautological
