POLLMAIL MODULE HELP

The pollmail module is a unidirectional IMAP-to-IRC gateway.

It periodically checks an IMAP mailbox for mail, searches for JSON in that mail, and outputs the
'msg' property of the JSON, if any. It can optionally require at least one JSON message to include a
password property so that pollmail doesn't process spam or unintended mail. This poor mans'
security should be complemented by (1) ensuring IMAP_USER_SSL is true (so password is not sent in the clear)
and (2) keeping the email address private

Messages are deleted on the IMAP server after being processed.

JSON can be anywhere in the mail: headers, body, subject. Typically, you should include it in custom mail
headers, but the capability to include it in the subj/body is convenient for senders who cannot output custom
mail headers (e.g., sending from gmail, JIRA, or other 3rd-party applications)

Thus, if you can control the headers, you can do this:

X-MADCOW: {{"msg": "I'll show up on IRC"}}

The JSON specifying the password does not require a message. So you could also send another header:
X-MADCOW-PASSWORD: {{"password": "supersecret"}}

The pollmail module has ten settings:

POLLMAIL_FREQUENCY: How often to check for mail.
POLLMAIL_USE_PASSWORD: Whether or not at least one JSON message must include a password
POLLMAIL_PASSWORD: The password to check for.
POLLMAIL_AUTOSTART: Only useful with the task -- sets whether the task should poll periodically at start.
POLLMAIL_JSON_REGEX: The regex to look for JSON. By default, expects the JSON to be wraped by another set of
curly braces: {{ ... }} *not { ... } in order to reduce the risk of accidentally processing unintended strings.

IMAP_SERVER, IMAP_PORT, IMAP_USERNAME, IMAP_PASSWORD, IMAP_USE_SSL: IMAP Connection settings

The pollmail module responds to three commands:

!pollmail now - Forces pollmail to poll now
!pollmail start - Enables the pollmail task to poll periodically. Only allowed by OWNER_NICK.
!pollmail stop - Disables the pollmail task from polling periodically. Only allowed by OWNER_NICK.
