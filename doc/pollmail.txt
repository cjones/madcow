POLLMAIL MODULE HELP

The pollmail module periodically checks an IMAP mailbox for mail, searches for JSON, and outputs the
'msg' property of the JSON. It can optionally require at least one JSON message have a password property, so
that people can't send arbitrary messages to output through your bot. Messages are deleted after being pulled.

The JSON can be anywhere in the email, including the headers.

Thus, if you can control the headers, you can do this:
X-MADCOW: {{"msg": "I'll show up on IRC"}}

The JSON with the password does not have to have a message. So you could also send another header:
X-MADCOW-PASSWORD: {{"password": "supersecret"}}


The pollmail module takes nine settings:

POLLMAIL_FREQUENCY: How often to check for mail.
POLLMAIL_USE_PASSWORD: Whether or not at least one JSON message has the password in it.
POLLMAIL_PASSWORD: The password to check for.
POLLMAIL_AUTOSTART: Only useful with the task -- sets whether the task should poll periodically at start.
POLLMAIL_JSON_REGEX: The regex to look for JSON. By default, expects the JSON to be wraped by another set of curly braces.

IMAP_SERVER, IMAP_PORT, IMAP_USERNAME, IMAP_PASSWORD, IMAP_USE_SSL: IMAP Connection settings

The pollmail module responds to three commands:

!pollmail now - Forces pollmail to poll.
!pollmail start - Enables the pollmail task to poll periodically. Only allowed by OWNER_NICK.
!pollmail stop - Disables the pollmail task from polling periodically. Only allowed by OWNER_NICK.
